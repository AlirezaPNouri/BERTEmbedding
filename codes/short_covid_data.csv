0,101520210312875,"The objective of this study was to test the effectiveness of ivermectin for the treatment of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a type 2 family RNA coronavirus similar to SARS-CoV-2. Female BALB/cJ mice were infected with 6,000 PFU of MHV-A59 (group infected, n = 20) or infected and then immediately treated with a single dose of 500 µg/kg ivermectin (group infected + IVM, n = 20) or were not infected and treated with PBS (control group, n = 16). Five days after infection/treatment, the mice were euthanized and the tissues were sampled to assess their general health status and infection levels. Overall, the results demonstrated that viral infection induced typical MHV-caused disease, with the livers showing severe hepatocellular necrosis surrounded by a severe lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltration associated with a high hepatic viral load (52,158 AU), while mice treated with ivermectin showed a better health status with a lower viral load (23,192 AU; p < 0.05), with only a few having histopathological liver damage (p < 0.05). No significant differences were found between the group infected + IVM and control group mice (P = NS). Furthermore, serum transaminase levels (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) were significantly lower in the treated mice than in the infected animals. In conclusion, ivermectin diminished the MHV viral load and disease in the mice, being a useful model for further understanding this therapy against coronavirus diseases."
1,10132021017568,"Drug abuse remains one of the major public health issues at the global level. In this article, we propose a drug epidemic model with a complete addiction–rehabilitation–recovery process, which allows the initiation of new users under the influence of drug addicts undergoing treatment and hidden drug addicts. We first conduct qualitative analyses of the dynamical behaviors of the model, including the existence and positivity of the solutions, the basic reproduction number, global asymptotic stabilities of both the drug-free and the drug-persistent equilibria, as well as sensitivity analysis. Then we use the model to predict the drug epidemic in China during 2020–2030. Finally, we numerically simulate the potential impact of intervention strategies on different drug users. The results show that the drug epidemic will decrease significantly during 2020−2030, and the most effective intervention strategy to eliminate drug epidemics is to strengthen the investigation and rehabilitation admission of hidden drug users."
2,10092020095621,"In June 2020, Arizona, U.S., emerged as one of the world's worst coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) spots after the stay-at-home order was lifted in the middle of May. However, with the decisions to reimpose restrictions, the number of COVID-19 cases has been declining, and Arizona is considered to be a good model in slowing the epidemic. In this paper, we aimed to examine the COVID-19 situation in Arizona and assess the impact of human mobility change. We constructed the mobility integrated metapopulation susceptible-infectious-removed model and fitted to publicly available datasets on COVID-19 cases and mobility changes in Arizona. Our simulations showed that by reducing human mobility, the peak time was delayed, and the final size of the epidemic was decreased in all three regions. Our analysis suggests that rapid and effective decision making is crucial to control human mobility and, therefore, COVID-19 epidemics. Until a vaccine is available, reimplementations of mobility restrictions in response to the increase of new COVID-19 cases might need to be considered in Arizona and beyond."
3,10072020074485,"The success of an antiviral drug depends on its potency to neutralize the virus in vitro and its ability after administration in vivo to reach the anatomic compartments that fuel viral dissemination in the body. For instance, remdesivir, a potent SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drug based on studies in vitro, if administered orally would be poorly effective because low drug levels would reach the lungs due to its high first pass destruction in the liver. This is the reason remdesivir can only be administered intravenously, a requirement that clearly limits its use as a prophylactic agent for COVID-19, although novel formulations for its easier administration are under development. Whether an antiviral prophylaxis could further control or even stop the COVID-19 epidemic in synergy with other non-pharmacological based mitigation strategies is today unknown. Since the mid-1960s, pharmacologists have investigated the use of lipid-based nanoparticles for efficient delivery of antivirals to tissues, for example by transforming the route of administration from intravenous to oral, subcutaneous or aerosol administrations. These novel encapsulation strategies have also the potential to maintain high levels of the antiviral drugs in tissues, with reduced dose frequency compared to the non-encapsulated drug. Several lipid-based nanoparticles are today approved by the US Food and Drug Administration or being tested in clinical studies with favorable toxicity profiles. Nonhuman primate models of coronavirus infection offer unique platforms to accelerate the search for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral prophylaxis. Paradigms, to corroborate this claim, are borrowed from nonhuman primate research studies, some of which had a profound impact on global public health in the specific setting of the AIDS pandemic. Sharing information from nonhuman primate research programs, invoking principles of scientific transparency and bioethics similar to those universally agreed for human studies, would also likely significantly help our collective fight (as the human species) against this public health emergency."
4,100620200610795,"Stroke has been considered as one of the underlying diseases that increases the probability of severe infection and mortality. Meanwhile, there are ongoing reports of stroke subsequent to COVID-19 infection. In this narrative paper, we reviewed major neurologic adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and pharmacokinetics of drugs which are routinely used for COVID-19 infection and their potential drug–drug interactions (PDDIs) with common drugs used for the treatment of stroke. It is highly recommended to monitor patients on chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), antiviral drugs, and/or corticosteroids about initiation or progression of cardiac arrhythmias, delirium, seizure, myopathy, and/or neuropathy. In addition, PDDIs of anti-COVID-19 drugs with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), anticoagulants, antiaggregants, statins, antihypertensive agents, and iodine-contrast agents should be considered. The most dangerous PDDIs were interaction of lopinavir/ritonavir or atazanavir with clopidogrel, prasugrel, and new oral anticoagulants (NOACs)."

Disruption of the health-care system caused by the COVID-19 pandemic exposed weak points in clinical pathways for diagnosis and treatment of giant cell arteritis, but has also permitted innovative solutions. The essential roles played by all professionals, including general practitioners and surgeons, in treating these patients have become evident.

8,10052020058414,"Background The world is facing the Coronavirus pandemic which is highly infectious. A number of measures have been put in place to prevent its spread among the population. However, for these preventive measures to be effective, the population requires an appropriate and sufficient knowledge. Thus, a survey was conducted with the aim of assessing the awareness, knowledge, attitude and practices towards measures for prevention of the spread of Covid-19 amongst Ugandans. Methods This was a cross-sectional study conducted during the lockdown in Uganda. An online questionnaire and a snowballing approach was used for participant recruitment of 18 years above literate Ugandans. Data collection was done from 6th to 15th April 2020 during which 1763 people participated. We analyzed all data using STATA 14.2, applying appropriate statistical tests. Results Out of 1763 participants, 97.6% were aware of the current pandemic. 83.9% of participants had a good knowledge score (21.8/27), 72.4% had a good attitude and 85.3% were practicing measures to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus disease. The ordered logistic regression showed that being a Health worker was significantly associated with a high knowledge (aOR:6 (3.32-10.93); a good attitude (aOR:2.5(1.68-3.8)]) and good practice (aOR:2.9 (1.95-4.2). On contrary, being a driver, business entrepreneur and a security personnel were found to have less rate in awareness, knowledge, attitude and practice. Conclusions Ugandans had a good overall awareness, knowledge, attitude and practice. However, there is still a gap of knowledge, attitude and practice among drivers, business entrepreneur and security personnel. There is a need to mobilize the population in the country to have the same degree of awareness and knowledge which will have an impact on attitude and practice to prevent spread of COVID-19."
9,10052020057727,"ABSTRACT Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease and risk factors are more likely to experience adverse outcomes associated with the novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Additionally, consistent reports of cardiac injury and de novo cardiac complications, including possible myocarditis, arrhythmia, and heart failure in patients without prior cardiovascular disease or significant risk factors, are emerging, possibly due to an accentuated host immune response and cytokine release syndrome. As the spread of the virus increases exponentially, many patients will require medical care either for COVID-19 related or traditional cardiovascular issues. While the COVID-19 pandemic is dominating the attention of the healthcare system, there is an unmet need for a standardized approach to deal with COVID-19 associated and other traditional cardiovascular issues during this period. We provide consensus guidance for the management of various cardiovascular conditions during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic with the goal of providing the best care to all patients and minimizing the risk of exposure to frontline healthcare workers."
10,10112020110327,"If taken at their word, senior policymakers in the major economic powers have drawn adverse conclusions concerning the performance of cross-border supply chains during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. That such supply chains often implicate China, the origin of the pandemic, has also led to claims that trading partners have become too dependent on Chinese supplies. This in turn has led to policy interventions designed to reconfigure supply chains, which if adopted broadly could revise the terms upon which international business operates. A critical evaluation of this policymaker assessment is presented, based on near-time monitoring of medical and food trade disruption induced by government policy, on fine-grained trade data on the pre-pandemic international sourcing patterns of medical goods and medicines by France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States, on statements from U.S. government health experts before and during the pandemic on the frequency and sources of medicine shortages, and on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s latest evidence on the causes of medicine shortages in 2020. Such evidence vitiates the adverse conclusions mentioned above, but raises important questions about the factors that determine policy towards international business during a time of intensifying geopolitical rivalry."
11,10122020126337,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a serious global burden. Epidemiological data suggest that the severity of COVID-19, in particular its case fatality rate, rises strongly with age. It is possible that neither a vaccine nor an effective treatment will be available for >1 year. Thus, it may be necessary for older adults to protect themselves by avoiding direct social contact and practicing social distancing for a rather long period of time. This may result in loneliness and social isolation because, for example, grandchildren cannot visit their grandparents. In turn, both loneliness and social isolation can have serious deleterious consequences (e.g., in terms of morbidity and mortality). Thus, the question arises: are there ways to mitigate loneliness and social isolation? One way to stay in contact is to use online social media such as Facebook or using video calling software such as Skype. However, there are very few studies examining whether the use of online social media or video chats are associated with loneliness and social isolation in older adults. We sum up some preliminary findings and make a call for further research on the link between online social media use/video chat and loneliness, as well as social isolation, in older adults."
12,10062020061737,"The current situation of global pandemic COVID-19 can put the 1.1 million Rohingya refugees, living in Bangladesh, in a substantially vulnerable position. A poor, overcrowded living condition, limited access to safe drinking water and health services, and a restricted communication system have substantially increased the risk of rapid spread of COVID-19 in these refugee camps. As COVID-19 infection has already been reported in Bangladesh, this infection will inevitably proliferate among this segregated and neglected community. Thus, in this short report, we describe the current challenges Rohingya refugee camps are facing and suggest possible prevention measures to avoid COVID-19 in these vulnerable areas."
13,10082020080593,"[Image: see text] Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs or “quats”) make up a class of chemicals used as disinfectants in cleaning and other consumer products. While disinfection is recommended for maintaining a safe environment during the COVID-19 pandemic, the increased use of QACs is concerning as exposure to these compounds has been associated with adverse effects on reproductive and respiratory systems. We have determined the occurrence of 19 QACs in residential dust collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. QACs were detected in >90% of the samples collected during the pandemic at concentrations ranging from 1.95 to 531 μg/g (n = 40; median of 58.9 μg/g). The total QAC concentrations in these samples were significantly higher than in samples collected before the COVID-19 pandemic (p < 0.05; n = 21; median of 36.3 μg/g). Higher QAC concentrations were found in households that generally disinfected more frequently (p < 0.05). Disinfecting products commonly used in these homes were analyzed, and the QAC profiles in dust and in products were similar, suggesting that these products can be a significant source of QACs. Our findings indicate that indoor exposure to QACs is widespread and has increased during the pandemic."
14,10142021026174,"In the last three decades, researchers have utilized genome engineering to alter the DNA sequence in the living cells of a plethora of organisms, ranging from plants, fishes, mice, to even humans. This has been conventionally achieved by using methodologies such as single nucleotide insertion/deletion in coding sequences, exon(s) deletion, mutations in the promoter region, introducing stop codon for protein truncation, and addition of foreign DNA for functional elucidation of genes. However, recent years have witnessed the advent of novel techniques that use programmable site-specific nucleases like CRISPR/Cas9, TALENs, ZFNs, Cre/loxP system, and gene trapping. These have revolutionized the field of experimental transgenesis as well as contributed to the existing knowledge base of classical genetics and gene mapping. Yet there are certain experimental/technological barriers that we have been unable to cross while creating genetically modified organisms. Firstly, while interfering with coding strands, we inadvertently change introns, antisense strands, and other non-coding elements of the gene and genome that play integral roles in the determination of cellular phenotype. These unintended modifications become critical because introns and other non-coding elements, although traditionally regarded as “junk DNA,” have been found to play a major regulatory role in genetic pathways of several crucial cellular processes, development, homeostasis, and diseases. Secondly, post-insertion of transgene, non-coding RNAs are generated by host organism against the inserted foreign DNA or from the inserted transgene/construct against the host genes. The potential contribution of these non-coding RNAs to the resulting phenotype has not been considered. We aim to draw attention to these inherent flaws in the transgenic technology being employed to generate mutant mice and other model organisms. By overlooking these aspects of the whole gene and genetic makeup, perhaps our current understanding of gene function remains incomplete. Thus, it becomes important that, while using genetic engineering techniques to generate a mutant organism for a particular gene, we should carefully consider all the possible elements that may play a potential role in the resulting phenotype. This perspective highlights the commonly used mouse strains and the most probable associated complexities that have not been considered previously, resulting in possible limitations in the currently utilized transgenic technology. This work also warrants the use of already established mouse lines in further research."
15,10072020075943,"Recent years in Europe have generated situations requiring the European Union to take extra-coordinated action in the field of asylum policy. The sudden and growing influx of refugees to Europe in 2015 and 2016 has caused the collapse of the previous common European asylum system. The European Union has taken a number of measures to resolve this crisis situation. When the situation seemed to be under control, a new challenge emerged in early 2020. The first COVID-19 infectious disease case was reported in Europe, and on 13 March 2020 the WHO reported that Europe had become the epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic. The measures taken by individual countries and the European Union to limit the spread of the virus have had a significant impact on many spheres of state and individual functioning, including the situation of persons seeking international protection. This publication consists of three parts. The first part discusses actions taken by the European Union in the face of the migration and refugee crisis that emerged in 2015 and 2016. The second part presents one of the limitations introduced in connection with preventing the spread of COVID-19, which has a huge impact on persons wishing to seek international protection, i.e., changes in the regime of crossing borders and entering the territory of particular countries. The third one points out selected problems experienced by persons seeking protection who already stay in the territory of EU Member States."
16,10042020043953,"Severe respiratory consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have prompted urgent need for novel therapies. Cell-based approaches, primarily using mesenchymal stem (stromal) cells (MSCs), have demonstrated safety and possible efficacy in patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), although not as yet well studied in respiratory virus-induced ARDS. Limited pre-clinical data suggest that systemic MSC administration can significantly reduce respiratory virus (Influenza strains H5N1 and H9N2)-induced lung injury, however, there are no available data in models of coronavirus respiratory infection. There are a rapidly increasing number of clinical investigations of cell-based therapy approaches for COVID-19. These utilise a range of different cell sources, doses, dosing strategies, and targeted patient populations. To provide a rationale strategy to maximise potential therapeutic use, it is critically important to understand the relevant pre-clinical studies and postulated mechanisms of MSC actions in respiratory virus-induced lung injuries. These are presented along with consideration of current clinical investigations."

The novel corona virus is continuously spread its range of effectiveness in nearly all corners of the world. Here we analyze that under what parameters and conditions it is possible to slow the speed of spreading of corona virus. We formulate a transmission dynamical model where it is assumed that some portion of the people generates the infections, which is affected by the quarantine and latent time. We study the effect of various parameters of corona virus through the fractional mathematical model. The Laguerre collocation technique is used to deal with the concerned mathematical model numerically. In order to deal with the dynamics of the novel corona virus we collect the experimental data from 15th–21st April, 2020 of Maharashtra state, India.

The pictorial presentation of the variation of different parameters used in model are depicted for upper and lower solution both."
18,10122020121458,"In the battle for control of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), we have few weapons. Yet contact tracing is among the most powerful. Contact tracing is the process by which public-health officials identify people, or contacts, who have been exposed to a person infected with a pathogen or another hazard. For all its power, though, contact tracing yields a variable level of success. One reason is that contact tracing's ability to break the chain of transmission is only as effective as the proportion of contacts who are actually traced. In part, this proportion turns on the quality of the information that infected people provide, which makes human memory a crucial part of the efficacy of contact tracing. Yet the fallibilities of memory, and the challenges associated with gathering reliable information from memory, have been grossly underestimated by those charged with gathering it. We review the research on witnesses and investigative interviewing, identifying interrelated challenges that parallel those in contact tracing, as well as approaches for addressing those challenges."
19,10062020066058,"Resumen La enfermedad por coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) es causada por el virus de Síndrome Respiratorio Agudo Grave - Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID 19 ha afectado cerca de 2 millones de personas en todo el mundo en menos de 4 meses posterior al reporte de los primeros casos en China en diciembre 2019. La relación que guarda la enfermedad por SARS-Cov-2 con el tratamiento inmunosupresor utilizado en diversos trastornos gastrointestinales es incierta, esto genera el debate sobre suspender el tratamiento inmunosupresor para mejorar el pronóstico de la infección, lo cual incluye el riesgo inherente de rechazo de injerto o agudización de enfermedades autoinmunes que potencialmente pudieran agravar el curso de la infección. En base a la evidencia disponible se logra establecer una postura de tratamiento en pacientes con enfermedades gastrointestinales que requieren terapia inmunosupresora. Abstract The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. COVID-19 affected close to 2 million persons worldwide in fewer than 4 months, after the report of the first cases in China in December 2019. The relation of the disease caused by SARS-Cov-2 to immunosuppressive treatment used in different gastrointestinal disorders is uncertain, resulting in debate with regard to suspending immunosuppressive therapy to improve infection outcome. Said suspension implies the inherent risk for graft rejection or autoimmune disease exacerbation that can potentially worsen the course of the infection. Based on the presently available evidence, a treatment stance has been established for patients with gastrointestinal diseases that require immunosuppressive therapy."
20,10052020050048,"Inherited thoracic aortopathies denote a group of congenital conditions that predispose to disease of the thoracic aorta. Aortic wall weakness and abnormal aortic hemodynamic profiles predispose these patients to dilatation of the thoracic aorta, which is generally silent but can precipitate aortic dissection or rupture with devastating and often fatal consequences. Current strategies to assess the future risk of aortic dissection or rupture are based primarily on monitoring aortic diameter. However, diameter alone is a poor predictor of risk, with many patients experiencing dissection or rupture below current intervention thresholds. Developing tools that improve the risk assessment of those with aortopathy is internationally regarded as a research priority. A robust understanding of the molecular pathways that lead to aortic wall weakness is required to identify biomarkers and therapeutic targets that could improve patient management. Here, we summarize the current understanding of the genetically determined mechanisms underlying inherited aortopathies and critically appraise the available blood biomarkers, imaging techniques, and therapeutic targets that have shown promise for improving the management of patients with these important and potentially fatal conditions."
21,10112020117448,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a surge in need for alternative routes of administration of drugs for end of life and palliative care, particularly in community settings. Transmucosal routes include intranasal, buccal, sublingual and rectal. They are non-invasive routes for systemic drug delivery with the possibility of self-administration, or administration by family caregivers. In addition, their ability to offer rapid onset of action with reduced first-pass metabolism make them suitable for use in palliative and end-of-life care to provide fast relief of symptoms. This is particularly important in COVID-19, as patients can deteriorate rapidly. Despite the advantages, these routes of administration face challenges including a relatively small surface area for effective drug absorption, small volume of fluid for drug dissolution and the presence of a mucus barrier, thereby limiting the number of drugs that are suitable to be delivered through the transmucosal route. In this review, the merits, challenges and limitations of each of these transmucosal routes are discussed. The goals are to provide insights into using transmucosal drug delivery to bring about the best possible symptom management for patients at the end of life, and to inspire scientists to develop new delivery systems to provide effective symptom management for this group of patients."
22,10082020081855,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a highly pathogenic human coronavirus causing severe disease and mortality. MERS-CoV infection failed to elicit robust IFN response, suggesting that the virus might have evolved strategies to evade host innate immune surveillance. In this study, we identified and characterized type I IFN antagonism of MERS-CoV open reading frame (ORF) 8b accessory protein. ORF8b was abundantly expressed in MERS-CoV-infected Huh-7 cells. When ectopically expressed, ORF8b inhibited IRF3-mediated IFN-β expression induced by Sendai virus and poly(I:C). ORF8b was found to act at a step upstream of IRF3 to impede the interaction between IRF3 kinase IKKε and chaperone protein HSP70, which is required for the activation of IKKε and IRF3. An infection study using recombinant wild-type and ORF8b-deficient MERS-CoV further confirmed the suppressive role of ORF8b in type I IFN induction and its disruption of the colocalization of HSP70 with IKKε. Ectopic expression of HSP70 relieved suppression of IFN-β expression by ORF8b in an IKKε-dependent manner. Enhancement of IFN-β induction in cells infected with ORF8b-deficient virus was erased when HSP70 was depleted. Taken together, HSP70 chaperone is important for IKKε activation, and MERS-CoV ORF8b suppresses type I IFN expression by competing with IKKε for interaction with HSP70."
23,10172021059202,"Developing robust methods to detect the severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a causative agent for the current global health pandemic, is an exciting area of research. Nevertheless, the currently used conventional reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique in COVID-19 diagnosis endures with some inevitable limitations. Consequently, the establishment of rapid diagnostic tools and quick isolation of infected patients is highly essential. Furthermore, the requirement of point-of-care testing is the need of the hour. Considering this, we have provided a brief review of the use of very recently reported robust spectral tools for rapid COVID-19 diagnosis. The spectral tools include, colorimetric reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS), with the admittance of principal component analysis (PCA) and machine learning (ML) for meeting the high-throughput and fool-proof diagnostic platforms for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, are reviewed. Recently, these techniques have been readily applied to screen a large number of suspected patients within a short period and they demonstrated higher sensitivity for the detection of COVID-19 patients from unaffected human subjects."

25,101420210212285,"The ongoing unprecedented severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak worldwide has highlighted the need for understanding viral-host interactions involved in mechanisms of virulence. Here, we show that the virulence factor Nsp1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the host messenger RNA (mRNA) export receptor heterodimer NXF1-NXT1, which is responsible for nuclear export of cellular mRNAs. Nsp1 prevents proper binding of NXF1 to mRNA export adaptors and NXF1 docking at the nuclear pore complex. As a result, a significant number of cellular mRNAs are retained in the nucleus during infection. Increased levels of NXF1 rescues the Nsp1-mediated mRNA export block and inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, antagonizing the Nsp1 inhibitory function on mRNA export may represent a strategy to restoring proper antiviral host gene expression in infected cells."
26,10132021010207,"BACKGROUND: Following non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), in-hospital delayed cerebral ischemia is predicted by two chief events on continuous EEG (cEEG): new or worsening epileptiform abnormalities (EAs) and deterioration of cEEG background frequencies. We evaluated the association between longitudinal outcomes and these cEEG biomarkers. We additionally evaluated the association between longitudinal outcomes and other in-hospital complications. METHODS: Patients with nontraumatic SAH undergoing ≥ 3 days of cEEG monitoring were enrolled in a prospective study evaluating longitudinal outcomes. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was assessed at discharge, and at 3- and 6-month follow-up time points. Adjusting for baseline severity in a cumulative proportional odds model, we modeled the mRS ordinally and measured the association between mRS and two forms of in-hospital cEEG deterioration: (1) cEEG evidence of new or worsening epileptiform abnormalities and (2) cEEG evidence of new background deterioration. We compared the magnitude of these associations at each time point with the association between mRS and other in-hospital complications: (1) delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), (2) hospital-acquired infections (HAI), and (3) hydrocephalus. In a secondary analysis, we employed a linear mixed effects model to examine the association of mRS over time (dichotomized as 0–3 vs. 4–6) with both biomarkers of cEEG deterioration and with other in-hospital complications. RESULTS: In total, 175 mRS assessments were performed in 59 patients. New or worsening EAs developed in 23 (39%) patients, and new background deterioration developed in 24 (41%). Among cEEG biomarkers, new or worsening EAs were independently associated with mRS at discharge, 3, and 6 months, respectively (adjusted cumulative proportional odds 4.99, 95% CI 1.60–15.6; 3.28, 95% CI 1.14–9.5; and 2.71, 95% CI 0.95–7.76), but cEEG background deterioration lacked an association. Among hospital complications, DCI was associated with discharge, 3-, and 6-month outcomes (adjusted cumulative proportional odds 4.75, 95% CI 1.64–13.8; 3.4; 95% CI 1.24–9.01; and 2.45, 95% CI 0.94–6.6), but HAI and hydrocephalus lacked an association. The mixed effects model demonstrated that these associations were sustained over longitudinal assessments without an interaction with time. CONCLUSION: Although new or worsening EAs and cEEG background deterioration have both been shown to predict DCI, only new or worsening EAs are associated with a sustained impairment in functional outcome. This novel finding raises the potential for identifying therapeutic targets that may also influence outcomes.

The patients tested positive for COVID-19 disease are kept in isolation with no interaction with the family members leading to negative mental health consequences. To address this, Parul Sevashram Hospital adapted to a more holistic approach to treatment. METHODOLOGY: A process documentation of the best practices was undertaken. Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) were used to gather responses of the project implementers (n = 2), physiotherapists (n = 2), dietician (n = 1), Ayurveda practitioners (n = 2), and staff nurses (n = 2) who were mainly involved in tailoring the package of services to be offered as well as their implementation. In addition, KIIs were also conducted with the patients (n = 10) their views on the additional package of services offered to them and the overall level of satisfaction with the care. FINDINGS: The holistic care services involved diet therapy, physiotherapy and yoga, AYUSH medicines for boosting immunity, music therapy and books and indoor games. Few implementation challenges include convincing healthcare workers for providing care to COVID patients, availing raw materials for preparing AYUSH medicines during lockdown. Trainings were also provided to HCW on infection control practices, provided monetary incentive and mobilised the existing resources for addressing the challenges. CONCLUSION: The holistic care has potential influence on patient's mental health, recovery rate, and satisfaction of COVID-19 patients. These approaches can be up-scaled with a minimum investment and has a potential to benefit patients both in public and private hospitals."
28,10112020116756,"Background: In the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, many countries made changes to the routine management of patients with non-communicable diseases, including neurocognitive disorders. Therefore, many “so-called” non-urgent elective procedures and outpatient appointments have been canceled or postponed, possibly impacting negatively on health and well-being of patients in the short- and long-term. Aim: Here, we aimed at describing numbers and types of outpatient appointments canceled as a result of government's restrictive measures in our memory clinic. Methods: The scheduled appointments at the memory clinic of the Santa Lucia Foundation IRCCS, Rome, Italy, are recorded in a comprehensive dataset under strict administrative control. Here, we compared appointments (first-time and follow-up) that were canceled from January to April 2020 with those of the corresponding months in 2019. Results: We observed a substantial decrease in appointments during 2020. The majority of scheduled appointments were follow-up, and about a quarter were first-time appointments. We estimated that 66.7% and 77.4% of patients missed out respectively their first and follow-up appointments in our memory clinic due to government's restrictive measures in March–April 2020. Conclusions: A large number of patients with neurocognitive disorders missed crucial appointments due to government's restrictive measures, and many experienced a delay in initial diagnosis and initiation of treatment. This has relevant impact on their treatment and consequently has (is still having and potentially will have) an increase on the healthcare service burden of clinics. Furthermore, as a second wave of COVID-19 affects Europe, and with winter approaching, it is a compelling priority to ensure easy and rapid access to appropriate assessment, care and treatment in the event of a new outbreak and potential subsequent lockdowns, with particular attention to the development of specific healthcare technologies customized to older persons with cognitive impairment."
29,10052020051356,"Many scientific processes and applications can be represented in the standardized form of workflows. One of the key challenges related to managing and executing workflows is scheduling. As an NP-hard problem with exponential complexity it imposes limitations on the size of practically solvable problems. In this paper, we present a solution to the challenge of scheduling workflow applications with the help of the D-Wave quantum annealer. To the best of our knowledge, there is no other work directly addressing workflow scheduling using quantum computing. Our solution includes transformation into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem and discussion of experimental results, as well as possible applications of the solution. For our experiments we choose four problem instances small enough to fit into the annealer’s architecture. For two of our instances the quantum annealer finds the global optimum for scheduling. We thus show that it is possible to solve such problems with the help of the D-Wave machine and discuss the limitations of this approach."
30,10062020067346,"SARS-CoV-2 is causing a pandemic resulting in high morbidity and mortality. COVID-19 patients suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are often critically ill and show lung injury and hemolysis. Heme is a prosthetic moiety crucial for the function of a wide variety of heme-proteins, including hemoglobin and cytochromes. However, injury-derived free heme promotes adhesion molecule expression, leukocyte recruitment, vascular permeabilization, platelet activation, complement activation, thrombosis, and fibrosis. Heme can be degraded by the anti-inflammatory enzyme heme oxygenase (HO) generating biliverdin/bilirubin, iron/ferritin, and carbon monoxide. We therefore postulate that free heme contributes to many of the inflammatory phenomena witnessed in critically ill COVID-19 patients, whilst induction of HO-1 or harnessing heme may provide protection. HO-activity not only degrades injurious heme, but its effector molecules possess also potent salutary anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. Until a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 becomes available, we need to explore novel strategies to attenuate the pro-inflammatory, pro-thrombotic, and pro-fibrotic consequences of SARS-CoV-2 leading to morbidity and mortality. The heme-HO system represents an interesting target for novel “proof of concept” studies in the context of COVID-19."
31,10122020120746,"BACKGROUND: Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, tenofovir (TAF/TDF) was identified as a potential agent for SARS-CoV-2 due to binding to RNA-dependent RNA polymerase similarly to remdesivir. This led to the hypothesis that TAF/TDF may be lessening the severity and improving outcomes of COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 Severity [Image: see text] COVID-19 Infection Outcomes [Image: see text] METHODS: Patients were identified by searching for HIV infection and SARS-CoV2 PCR testing. Type of antiretroviral therapy (ART), CD4+ cell count, HIV viral load (VL), comorbidities, presenting symptoms, severity of COVID infection, and outcomes were analyzed. COVID disease was classified as mild, moderate, severe, or critical based on World Health Organization criteria. We primarily sought to determine the effect of TAF/TDF on the severity of COVID infection. The secondary endpoint was to determine the effect of low CD4 count and HIV VL on the severity of infection. RESULTS: 39 HIV+ patients were tested at least once for SARS-CoV2 by PCR at VA NJ Health Care System. 18 of 39 patients were PCR positive. In those, common presenting symptoms included: fever (15/18), cough (7/18), and lethargy/fatigue (6/18). 16 of the 39 HIV+ patients’ ART included TAF/TDF; 8 of 18 COVID+ and 8 of 21 COVID-. In the COVID- group, 2 patients had CD4 count < 200 cells/mm(3), 3 patients had HIV VL >200, and 19 of 21 had at least 1 comorbidity. In the COVID+ group, 3 had CD4 count < 200 cells/mm(3), none had detectible HIV viremia, and all but one had comorbidities. Of COVID+ infections, 7 were mild, 3 moderate, 8 severe, and 5 patients died. 4 of the 5 patients that did not survive were in non-TAF/TDF group. All 3 patients with CD4 count < 200 cells/mm(3) had severe disease. 6 out of 8 patients developed mild disease in TAF/TDF group vs. 1 out of 10 patients in non-TAF/TDF group. 1 out of 8 and 7 out of 10 patients had severe or critical disease in TAF/TDF vs non-TAF/TDF groups respectively. CONCLUSION: In this sample of 18 HIV+ patients with COVID-19 infection, patients receiving TAF/TDF were more likely to develop mild disease and have full recovery than those who were on TAF/TDF-free regimens (75% vs. 10% and 87.5% vs. 50%, respectively). Patients not on TAF/TDF-based regimens had a higher rate of developing severe and critical COVID-19 disease (40% vs. 0% and 30% vs. 12.5%, respectively).

32,101220201210511,"In the wake of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the world has woken up to the importance of biosecurity and the need to manage international borders. Yet strong sectorial identities exist within biosecurity that are associated with specific international standards, individual economic interests, specific research communities, and unique stakeholder involvement. Despite considerable research addressing human, animal, plant, and environmental health, the science connections between these sectors remain quite limited. One Biosecurity aims to address these limitations at global, national, and local scales. It is an interdisciplinary approach to biosecurity policy and research that builds on the interconnections between human, animal, plant, and environmental health to effectively prevent and mitigate the impacts of invasive alien species. It provides an integrated perspective to address the many biosecurity risks that transcend the traditional boundaries of health, agriculture, and the environment. Individual invasive alien plant and animal species often have multiple impacts across sectors: as hosts of zoonotic parasites, vectors of pathogens, pests of agriculture or forestry, as well as threats to biodiversity and ecosystem function. It is time these risks were addressed in a systematic way. One Biosecurity is essential to address several major sociological and environmental challenges to biosecurity: climate change, increasing urbanisation, agricultural intensification, human global mobility, loss of technical capability as well as public resistance to pesticides and vaccines. One Biosecurity will require the bringing together of taxonomists, population biologists, modellers, economists, chemists, engineers, and social scientists to engage in a new agenda that is shaped by politics, legislation, and public perceptions."
33,10172021051886,"Molecular imaging using PET/CT or PET/MRI has evolved from an experimental imaging modality at its inception in 1972 to an integral component of diagnostic procedures in oncology, and, to lesser extent, in cardiology and neurology, by successfully offering in-vivo imaging and quantitation of key pathophysiological targets or molecular signatures, such as glucose metabolism in cancerous disease. Apart from metabolism probes, novel radiolabeled peptide and antibody PET tracers, including radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have entered the clinical arena, providing the in-vivo capability to collect target-specific quantitative in-vivo data on cellular and molecular pathomechanisms on a whole-body scale, and eventually, extract imaging biomarkers possibly serving as prognostic indicators. The success of molecular imaging in mapping disease severity on a whole-body scale, and directing targeted therapies in oncology possibly could translate to the management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), by identifying, localizing, and quantifying involvement of different immune mediated responses to the infection with SARS-COV2 during the course of acute infection and possible, chronic courses with long-term effects on specific organs. The authors summarize current knowledge for medical imaging in COVID-19 in general with a focus on molecular imaging technology and provide a perspective for immunologists interested in molecular imaging research using validated and immediately available molecular probes, as well as possible future targets, highlighting key targets for tailored treatment approaches as brought up by key opinion leaders."
34,10142021028159,"Chile has one of the worst numbers worldwide in terms of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases and COVID-19–related deaths per million inhabitants; thus, characterization of neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses in the general population is critical to understanding of immunity at the local level. Given our inability to perform massive classical neutralization assays due to the scarce availability of BSL-3 facilities in the country, we developed and fully characterized an HIV-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype, which was used in a 96-well plate format to investigate NAb responses in samples from individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or treated with convalescent plasma. We also identified samples with decreased or enhanced neutralization activity against the D614G spike variant compared with the wild type, indicating the relevance of this variant in host immunity. The data presented here represent the first insights into NAb responses in individuals from Chile, serving as a guide for future studies in the country."
35,10132021011119,"The article explores internal displacement from biological disasters such as epidemics and pandemics. The article analyses displacement in India from the coronavirus outbreak of 2019 and claims that the group of internal migrants who were unable to return to their homes and stranded in various parts of the country because of the national lockdown exhibits the characteristics of disaster-driven IDPs, and should, therefore, be treated so. This analysis reveals three main aspects leading up to a practical recommendation: the inconsistencies in the current Indian legal response can be attributed to the group’s non-recognition as internally displaced; the acknowledgment of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 as the appropriate national law to extend such protection; with the recommendation to explicitly integrate such persons as internally displaced under the Disaster Management Act. The article’s wider contribution is towards developing the corpus of protection to persons displaced by disasters under disaster management laws of countries."
36,10022020021070,"Background: The current novel coronavirus outbreak appears to have originated from a point-source exposure event at Huanan seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, China. There is still uncertainty around the scale and duration of this exposure event. This has implications for the estimated transmissibility of the coronavirus and as such, these potential scenarios should be explored. Methods: We used a stochastic branching process model, parameterised with available data where possible and otherwise informed by the 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, to simulate the Wuhan outbreak. We evaluated scenarios for the following parameters: the size, and duration of the initial transmission event, the serial interval, and the reproduction number (R0). We restricted model simulations based on the number of observed cases on the 25th of January, accepting samples that were within a 5% interval on either side of this estimate. Results: Using a pre-intervention SARS-like serial interval suggested a larger initial transmission event and a higher R0 estimate. Using a SARs-like serial interval we found that the most likely scenario produced an R0 estimate between 2-2.7 (90% credible interval (CrI)). A pre-intervention SARS-like serial interval resulted in an R0 estimate between 2-3 (90% CrI). There were other plausible scenarios with smaller events sizes and longer duration that had comparable R0 estimates. There were very few simulations that were able to reproduce the observed data when R0 was less than 1. Conclusions: Our results indicate that an R0 of less than 1 was highly unlikely unless the size of the initial exposure event was much greater than currently reported. We found that R0 estimates were comparable across scenarios with decreasing event size and increasing duration. Scenarios with a pre-intervention SARS-like serial interval resulted in a higher R0 and were equally plausible to scenarios with SARs-like serial intervals."
37,101620210412127,"The world is experiencing an unprecedented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-based vaccines are currently the main preventive agent to fight against the virus. However, several variants with extensive mutations in SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins have emerged. Some of these variants exhibited increased replication, higher transmission and virulence, and were partially resistant to antibody neutralization from natural infection or vaccination. With over 130 million confirmed cases and widespread vaccination around the globe, the emergence of new escape SARS-CoV-2 variants could be accelerated. New therapeutics insensitive to mutations are thus urgently needed. Here we have developed an inhibitor based on SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that potently reduced pseudovirus infectivity by limiting the level of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins on virion envelope. Most importantly, the inhibitor was equally effective against other coronavirus spike proteins that shared as low as 35% amino-acid sequence identity, underscoring its extreme tolerance to mutations. The small-sized inhibitor would also allow simple delivery by, for instance, nasal spray. We expect the inhibitor reported here to be an invaluable aid to help end COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the use of a partial native sequence or its homologues to interfere with the functions of the native protein represents a novel concept for targeting other viral proteins in combating against important viral pathogens."
38,10092020093250,"Due to collaborative relationships fostered with school staff and the ability to form long-term trusting relationships with students, school nurses are uniquely situated to address the issue of child abuse detection and prevention in this age of online education brought about by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). School nurses can and should champion the cause of child safety in their schools, even during school closures through the implementation of key nursing interventions such as staff education on detecting child abuse in online environments. School nurses can also protect children by supporting parents who are dealing with great stressors due to the current global pandemic. Providing resources for families, encouraging parental self-care, educating families about online safety, and encouraging family discussion about child abuse all help to prevent abuse and maltreatment of children. When child abuse goes unreported because of school closures, school nurses can bridge the gap and advocate for detection and prevention in online education."

Recent medical research has demonstrated the value of using online systems to predict emerging spatial distributions of transmittable diseases. Concerned internet users often resort to online sources in an effort to explain their medical symptoms. This raises the prospect that incidence of COVID-19 may be tracked online by search queries and social media posts analyzed by advanced methods in data science, such as Artificial Intelligence. Online queries can provide early warning of an impending epidemic, which is valuable information needed to support planning timely interventions. Identification of the location of clusters geographically helps to support containment measures by providing information for decision-making and modeling."

Y también ha servido para reconocer y encontrar formas alternativas con las que se puede transmitir el saber. En definitiva, el profesor ha tenido la oportunidad de contribuir a crear un modelo educativo capaz de impulsar el desarrollo de nuevas formas y métodos de aprendizaje. Ciertas técnicas y recursos educativos han podido ser reconocidos como “presentes” o “ausentes” de nuestro sistema educativo. Esto implica que ciertos recursos han de estar presentes, o que es preciso optimizar los que ya están disponibles para enseñar, para aprender, o para evaluar.

Abstract The virus, besides causing a pandemic, with hundreds of thousands ill, and with tens of thousands dead, has had the ability (“the power”) to break standard education practices. This has had, or may have, one benefit: to reconsider that which is really important and that which is not so important. And this is of great value for the teacher and for the student. And it has also served to recognise and find alternative ways to transmit the knowledge. All things considered, the teacher has had the opportunity to contribute in creating an education model capable of boosting the development of new ways and methods of learning. Certain educational techniques and resources have been able to be recognised as “present” or “absent” in our education system. This implies that certain recourses have to be present, or that is required to optimise those that are available in order to teach, to learn, or to evaluate. Technology helps to provide “direct” contact between teacher and student, between teachers and between students. But it goes without saying that the technology has to be available."
41,10112020119465,"Correctional and detention facilities have been disproportionately affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) because of shared space and movement of staff members and detained persons within facilities (1,2). During March 1-April 30, 2020, at Cook County Jail in Chicago, Illinois, >900 COVID-19 cases were diagnosed across all 10 housing divisions, representing 13 unique buildings.† Movement within the jail was examined through network analyses and visualization, a field that examines elements within a network and the connections between them. This methodology has been used to supplement contact tracing investigations for tuberculosis and to understand how social networks contribute to transmission of sexually transmitted infections (3-5). Movements and connections of 5,884 persons (3,843 [65%] detained persons and 2,041 [35%] staff members) at the jail during March 1-April 30 were analyzed. A total of 472 (12.3%) COVID-19 cases were identified among detained persons and 198 (9.7%) among staff members. Among 103,701 shared-shift connections among staff members, 1.4% occurred between persons with COVID-19, a percentage that is significantly higher than the expected 0.9% by random occurrence alone (p<0.001), suggesting that additional transmission occurred within this group. The observed connections among detained persons with COVID-19 were significantly lower than expected (1.0% versus 1.1%, p<0.001) when considering only the housing units in which initial transmission occurred, suggesting that the systematic isolation of persons with COVID-19 is effective at limiting transmission. A network-informed approach can identify likely points of high transmission, allowing for interventions to reduce transmission targeted at these groups or locations, such as by reducing convening of staff members, closing breakrooms, and cessation of contact sports."

Yet, the mechanisms are unclear and biomarkers are limited. Early in the pandemic, we observed markedly elevated factor V activity in a patient with COVID‐19, which led us to measure factor V, VIII, and X activity in a cohort of 102 consecutive inpatients with COVID‐19. Contemporaneous SARS‐CoV‐2‐negative controls (n = 17) and historical pre‐pandemic controls (n = 260–478) were also analyzed. This cohort represents severe COVID‐19 with high rates of ventilator use (92%), line clots (47%), deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE) (23%), and mortality (22%). Factor V activity was significantly elevated in COVID‐19 (median 150 IU/dL, range 34–248 IU/dL) compared to contemporaneous controls (median 105 IU/dL, range 22–161 IU/dL) (P < 0.00001)—the strongest association with COVID‐19 of any parameter studied, including factor VIII, fibrinogen, and D‐dimer. Patients with COVID‐19 and factor V activity >150 IU/dL exhibited significantly higher rates of DVT/PE (16/49, 33%) compared to those with factor V activity ≤150 IU/dL (7/53, 13%) (P = 0.03). Within this severe COVID‐19 cohort, factor V activity associated with SARS‐CoV‐2 viral load in a sex‐dependent manner. Subsequent decreases in factor V were linked to progression toward DIC and mortality. Together, these data reveal marked perturbations of factor V activity in severe COVID‐19, provide links to SARS‐CoV‐2 disease biology and clinical outcomes, and nominate a candidate biomarker to investigate for guiding anticoagulation therapy in COVID‐19.

44,101020201012253,"Psychiatric illnesses are an important contributor of morbidity and mortality in older adults. There is increase in older adults with psychiatric disorders paralleling their growth in absolute numbers. This leads to challenges in mental health care and service delivery. Several barriers that exists in our community hinder older adults from receiving mental health care. Additionally, lack of adequate human resources in geriatric mental health care compounds the problem. Telemedicine, though not new in other fields of medicine, is relatively new in the practice of psychiatry in India. This is probably due to lack of clear guidelines and regulations regarding the same in India. There is a recent increase in teleconsultations in India similar to other developed countries due to ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The recent telepsychiatry operational guidelines have made telepsychiatry a legitimate and official practice in India. Challenges specific to older adults in the form of low digital literacy, sensory issues, and cognitive impairment can be overcome by adopting telepsychiatry services in coming years.

45,10132021016676,"The COVID-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented stress on health care systems across the globe. This stress has altered prenatal, labor, delivery, and postpartum care in the U.S., motivating many pregnant people to seek maternal health care with community midwives in a home or freestanding birth center setting. Although the dominant maternal health care providers across the globe, community midwives work on the margins of the U.S. health care system, in large part due to policy restrictions. This commentary extends previous research to theorize that the COVID-19-related disrupted health care system and the heightened visibility of community midwives may create a “focusing event,” or policy window, which may enable midwives and their advocates to shift policy."
46,10142021020505,"Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K or Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, CAMKIII) is a new member of an atypical α-kinase family different from conventional protein kinases that is now considered as a potential target for the treatment of cancer. This protein regulates the phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) to restrain activity and inhibit the elongation stage of protein synthesis. Mounting evidence shows that eEF2K regulates the cell cycle, autophagy, apoptosis, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis in several types of cancers. The expression of eEF2K promotes survival of cancer cells, and the level of this protein is increased in many cancer cells to adapt them to the microenvironment conditions including hypoxia, nutrient depletion, and acidosis. The physiological function of eEF2K and its role in the development and progression of cancer are here reviewed in detail. In addition, a summary of progress for in vitro eEF2K inhibitors from anti-cancer drug discovery research in recent years, along with their structure–activity relationships (SARs) and synthetic routes or natural sources, is also described. Special attention is given to those inhibitors that have been already validated in vivo, with the overall aim to provide reference context for the further development of new first-in-class anti-cancer drugs that target eEF2K."
47,10132021019545,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has put a spotlight on political leadership around the world. Differences in how leaders address the pandemic through public messages have practical implications for building trust and an effective response within a country. METHODS: We analysed the speeches made by 20 heads of government around the world (Bangladesh, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Dominican Republic, Finland, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, New Zealand, Niger, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Scotland, Sint Maarten, United Kingdom, United States and Taiwan) to highlight the differences between men and women leaders in discussing COVID-19. We used an inductive analytical approach, coding speeches for specific themes based on language and content. FINDINGS: Five primary themes emerged across a total of 122 speeches on COVID-19, made by heads of government: economics and financial relief, social welfare and vulnerable populations, nationalism, responsibility and paternalism, and emotional appeals. While all leaders described the economic impact of the pandemic, women spoke more frequently about the impact on the individual scale. Women leaders were also more often found describing a wider range of social welfare services, including: mental health, substance abuse and domestic violence. Both men and women from lower-resource settings described detailed financial relief and social welfare support that would impact the majority of their populations. While 17 of the 20 leaders used war metaphors to describe COVID-19 and the response, men largely used these with greater volume and frequency. CONCLUSION: While this analysis does not attempt to answer whether men or women are more effective leaders in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, it does provide insight into the rhetorical tools and types of language used by different leaders during a national and international crisis. This analysis provides additional evidence on the differences in political leaders’ messages and priorities to inspire citizens’ adhesion to the social contract in the adoption of response and recovery measures. However, it does not consider the influence of contexts, such as the public audience, on leaders’ strategic communication approaches."
48,10102020102922,"Background The related research of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the mental health of community residents is still lacking. Here we reported the mental health status of Chinese residents as well as the community's prevention and control during the pandemic period of COVID-19 and further explored the influencing factors of mental status. Methods In this cross-sectional study, convenience sampling and snowball sampling methods were adopted from February 16 to February 23, 2020, and Chinese community residents were included according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Three questionnaires, including General Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), and a self-designed ""Community prevention and control questionnaire"", were used. A multivariate linear regression analysis was conducted to analyze the impact factors of anxiety and depression. Results A total of 3,001 community residents were included in this study. In total, 85.6% and 83.7% of participants had minimal anxiety and depression, respectively. Among all the community residents, 16.6% of participants proved that the communities they lived in had confirmed cases. 95.3% of participants reported that the residents were screened for mobility and contact history. 97.8% of participants reported the entrance and exit of the community were managed in their communities. There were 97.5% and 99% of participants needed to take body temperature and wear masks in their communities. Ninety-two percent (92%) of communities have their public areas and facilities disinfected daily, and 95.4% of communities have conducted health education about COVID-19. Factors including gender, education level, chronic illness, the frequency of going out, achieving information about COVID-19 by community and newspaper, and confirmed cases in the community, show association with community residents' anxiety and depression. Conclusions The vast majority of Chinese residents have little anxiety and depression, and most communities have adopted standardized control measures following the government's regulations and policy, which plays a vital role in the control of COVID-19 and improving residents' anxiety and depression."
49,100920200913452,"Anosmia is a well-described symptom of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Several respiratory viruses are able to cause post-viral olfactory dysfunction, suggesting a sensorineural damage. Since the olfactory bulb is considered an immunological organ contributing to prevent the invasion of viruses, it could have a role in host defense. The inflammatory products locally released in COVID-19, leading to a local damage and causing olfactory loss, simultaneously may interfere with the viral spread into the central nervous system. In this context, olfactory receptors could play a role as an alternative way of SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells locally, in the central nervous system, and systemically. Differences in olfactory bulb due to sex and age may contribute to clarify the different susceptibility to infection and understand the role of age in transmission and disease severity. Finally, evaluation of the degree of functional impairment (grading), central/peripheral anosmia (localization), and the temporal course (evolution) may be useful tools to counteract COVID-19."

51,10172021050540,"On March 12, 2020, Norway went on lockdown to handle the COVID-19 outbreak. Near overnight, people faced a new and unfamiliar situation, with restrictive measures in place, extensive uncertainty and the closing down of much of society. The present study explores the meaning-making and coping in everyday life of 16 participants interviewed early in the pandemic. Norway, compared to many other settings in the world, is a privileged context. Nonetheless, participants struggled with this breach with their normal lives. The participants spoke of adapting to the new normal, how the concept of time had changed, how they handled socialisation, dealing with restricted freedom, and imagining the future. Actively drawing on communal coping, as well as problem-focused and emotion-focused individual coping strategies, participants’ accounts illustrate the on-going process of making meaning of their new lives under lockdown. In our discussion, we synthesise various coping processes that the participants made use of in their handling of the new situation. Even though the COVID-19 pandemic is a shared stressor, it influences people differently, and our research contributes with valuable insights into this variation. The recognition of different meaning-making and coping strategies is crucial, as it can constructively inform the development of political and social responses to the pandemic that actively encompasses the variation in individual experiences and ramifications."
52,10122020127029,"An ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now the greatest threat to the global public health. Herbal medicines and their derived natural products have drawn much attention to treat COVID-19, but there has been no natural product showing inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection with detailed mechanism. Here, we show that platycodin D (PD), a triterpenoid saponin abundant in Platycodon grandiflorum (PG), a dietary and medicinal herb commonly used in East Asia, effectively blocks the two main SARS-CoV-2 infection-routes via lysosome- and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2)-driven entry. Mechanistically, PD prevents host-entry of SARS-CoV-2 by redistributing membrane cholesterol to prevent membrane fusion, which can be reinstated by treatment with a PD-encapsulating agent. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of PD are recapitulated by a pharmacological inhibition or gene-silencing of NPC1, which is mutated in Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) patients displaying disrupted membrane cholesterol. Finally, readily available local foods or herbal medicines containing PG root show the similar inhibitory effects against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our study proposes that PD is a potent natural product for preventing or treating COVID-19 and that a brief disruption of membrane cholesterol can be a novel therapeutic approach against SARS-CoV-2 infection."
53,10112020111039,"Despite economic challenging times, a small insurance company (when compared to current industry leaders in developing countries) has stunned competitors by achieving extraordinary organizational success in a relative short time span. The organization is rapidly expanding their current market share and are winning awards for it. This achievement is quite noteworthy considering that prospective competitors in the insurance industry are often challenged by numerous market barriers in developing countries. These barriers include an existing saturated market with many big competitors offering insurance products at cut-throat prices. Adding to the challenge is the market’s strict compliance regulation prescriptions. This sparked the interest to investigate how this organization has achieved their success. A case study approach was used to investigate the extent to which the eight factors of a business strategy development approach – the Eight S model as proposed by Higgins [1] – was used and subsequently contributed to the overall success of the organization. After numerous observations, the analysis of secondary documentation and open-ended interviews across different levels of the organization, the main finding was that the seven contextual factors of the Eight S model proposed by Higgins [1] namely – strategy and purpose, structure, systems and processes, management style, staff, shared values contributing to strategic performance – were to some extent implemented in the organization. However, the main contributor towards achieving their success was the re-Sources (resources) factor. The strong focus on the re-Sources factor highlighted well established IT systems which included a strong focus on data analytics, in particular a management dashboard for monitoring organizational performance."

55,101420210211954,"The serological responses towards severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) nucleoprotein, receptor‐binding domain (RBD), and spike protein S1 are characterized by incomplete avidity maturation. Analysis with varying concentrations of urea allows to determine distinct differences in avidity maturation, though the total process remains at an unusually low level. Despite incomplete avidity maturation, this approach allows to define early and late stages of infection. It therefore can compensate for the recently described irregular kinetic patterns of immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G (IgG) directed towards SARS‐CoV‐2 antigens. The serological responses towards seasonal coronaviruses neither have a negative nor positive impact on SARS‐CoV‐2 serology in general. Avidity determination in combination with measurement of antibody titers and complexity of the immune response allows to clearly differentiate between IgG responses towards seasonal coronaviruses and SARS‐CoV‐2. Cross‐reactions seem to occur with very low probability. They can be recognized by their pattern of response and through differential treatment with urea. As high avidity has been shown to be essential in several virus systems for the protective effect of neutralizing antibodies, it should be clarified whether high avidity of IgG directed towards RBD indicates protective immunity. If this is the case, monitoring of avidity should be part of the optimization of vaccination programs."
56,10052020055130,"Abstract Background The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) that is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently been designated a pandemic by the World Health Organization, affecting 2.7 million individuals globally as of April 25, 2020 with over 187,000 deaths. A growing body of evidence supports central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Methods We conducted a review of the literature for articles concerning COVID-19 pathophysiology, neurological manifestations, and neuroscience provider recommendations and guidelines. Results CNS manifestations range from vague non-focal complaints to severe neurologic impairment associated with encephalitis. It is unclear whether neurological dysfunction is due to direct viral injury or systemic disease. The virus may affect brainstem pathways that lead to indirect respiratory dysfunction in addition to direct pulmonary injury. Necessary adaptations in patient management, triage, and diagnosis are evolving in light of ongoing scientific and clinical findings. Conclusions This review consolidates the current body of literature regarding the neurological impact of coronaviruses, discusses the reported neurologic manifestations of COVID-19, and highlights recommendations for patient management. Specific recommendations pertaining to clinical practice for neurologists and neurosurgeons are provided."

Case presentation A 32-year-old patient who had had a nontraumatic vaginal delivery presented to the emergency room with abdominal pain and anuria. Computed tomography showed free fluid in the peritoneal cavity. An exploratory laparoscopy revealed a perforation on the bladder dome that was laparoscopically sutured. Conclusion In the presence of an acute abdominal pain with free fluid in the peritoneal cavity after a nontraumatic vaginal delivery, a differential diagnosis should be a spontaneous rupture of the bladder."
58,10122020124520,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, the emergence of a new condition with hyperinflammatory shock, resembling Kawasaki disease (KD), was reported in children from Western countries strongly affected by SARS-CoV-2. This syndrome was termed paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (PIMS-TS). Despite displaying features similar to KD, studies demonstrated a new and more severe disease entity with multiorgan involvement, in particular gastrointestinal symptoms and heart failure, with blood tests consistent with a postinfectious inflammatory condition as summarised in this review."
59,10172021053049,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate how the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected tympanostomy tube placement and practice patterns. STUDY DESIGN A retrospective review of billing data. SETTING A large-volume practice with both community and tertiary care providers. METHODS As part of a quality initiative, billing data were queried to identify children <18 years of age who underwent tympanostomy tube placement between January 2019 and December 2020. Patient age, practice location, and case numbers were gathered. RESULTS The study included data from 2652 patients. Prior to state-mandated clinic and operating room restrictions, there were no significant differences in the number of tympanostomy tubes placed (P = .64), including month-to-month comparisons, the distribution of patients being cared for at community vs tertiary care sites (P = .63), or patient age at the time of surgery (P = .97) between 2019 and 2020. After resumption of outpatient clinical and elective surgical activities, the number of tympanostomy tubes placed decreased significantly between 2019 and 2020 (831 vs 303 cases, P = .003), with a persistent month-to-month difference. In addition, patients undergoing tube placement were older (4.5 vs 3.2 years, P < .001). The distribution of cases performed in the community setting decreased during this time period as well (P < .001). CONCLUSION During the COVID-19 pandemic, the rate of pediatric tympanostomy tube placement has significantly decreased. The age of patients undergoing surgery has increased, and more children are being cared for in a tertiary setting. These findings may reflect changes in the prevalence of acute and chronic otitis media as the result of the pandemic."
60,10152021030917,"There is increasing evidence of neurological and psychiatric manifestations in patients with COVID-19 [1, 2]. Recent postmortem studies reported a large spectrum of neuropathological features that support the neuro-invasive potential of SARS-CoV-2 [3–5]. Given the complex pathophysiology of COVID-19 associated neurological manifestation, the pathological changes observed at postmortem examination often reflect the combination of both direct and indirect cytopathic effects mediated by the virus, as well as of nonspecific complications of severe disease in the deceased patients with COVID-19 (i.e. critical illness-related encephalopathy [6]; and/or pre-existing medical conditions). Thus, all these factors need to be considered when interpreting neuropathological findings [3, 7]. Hypoxia-ischemia, observed in the majority of critically ill cases of Covid-19, does not account for all relevant neuropathological observations provided by postmortem neuropathological studies in single cases or small patient cohorts [8–14]. However, among these studies the extent and significance of neuroinflammatory changes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection are still matter of discussion, with often contradictory conclusions. In particular, it remains unclear to what extent the reported microglia activation and occasionally the presence of sparse lymphocytic infiltrates (T lymphocytes) represents COVID-19-specific findings [6, 7]."

63,10092020098305,"This study is an overview of the current and future trajectory, as well as the impact of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) in the world and selected countries including the state of Kuwait. The selected countries were divided into two groups: Group A (China, Switzerland, and Ireland) and Group B (USA, Brazil, and India) based on their outbreak containment of this virus. Then, the actual data for each country were fitted to a regression model utilizing the excel solver software to assess the current and future trajectory of novel COVID-19 and its impact. In addition, the data were fitted using the Susceptible–Infected–Recovered (SIR) Model. The Group A trajectory showed an “S” shape trend that suited a logistic function with r(2) > 0.97, which is an indication of the outbreak control. The SIR models for the countries in this group showed that they passed the expected 99% end of pandemic dates. Group B, however, exhibited a continuous increase of the total COVID-19 new cases, that best suited an exponential growth model with r(2) > 0.97, which meant that the outbreak is still uncontrolled. The SIR models for the countries in this group showed that they are still relatively far away from reaching the expected 97% end of pandemic dates. The maximum death percentage varied from 3.3% (India) to 7.2% with USA recording the highest death percentage, which is virtually equal to the maximum death percentage of the world (7.3%). The power of the exponential model determines the severity of the country’s trajectory that ranged from 11 to 19 with the USA and Brazil having the highest values. The maximum impact of this COVID-19 pandemic occurred during the uncontrolled stage (2), which mainly depended on the deceptive stage (1). Further, some novel potential containment strategies are discussed. Results from both models showed that the Group A countries contained the outbreak, whereas the Group B countries still have not reached this stage yet. Early measures and containment strategies are imperative in suppressing the spread of COVID-19."
64,10162021040952,"BACKGROUND: During the Covid-19 pandemic, non‐operative management for acute appendicitis (AA) was implemented in the UK. Aim of this study was to determine the efficacy and outcomes of conservative versus surgical management of AA during the pandemic. MATERIALS & METHODS: We conducted an observational study in a tertiary referral centre. Data was collected from patients (≥16 years) with a diagnosis of AA between 1st November 2019 to 10th March 2020 (pre-COVID period) and 10th March 2020 to 5th July 2020 (COVID period). RESULTS: A total of 116 patients in the pre-COVID period were included versus 91 in the COVID period. 43.1% (n = 50) of patients pre-COVID were classified as ASA 2 compared to 26.4% (n = 24) during the COVID period (p-value=0.042). 72.5% (n = 66) of the patients during the COVID period scored as high risk using the Alvarado score compared to 24.1% (n = 28) in the pre-COVID period (p-value<0.001). We observed a significant increase in radiological evaluation, 69.8% versus 87.5% of patients had a CT in the pre-COVID and COVID periods respectively (p-value=0.008). 94.9% of patients were managed operatively in the pre-COVID period compared to 60.4% in the COVID period (p-value<0.001). We observed more open appendicectomies (37.3% versus 0.9%; p-value<0.001) during the COVID period compared to the pre-COVID period. More abscess formation and free fluid were found intraoperatively in the COVID period (p-value= 0.021 and 0.023 respectively). Re-attendance rate due to appendicitis-related issues was significantly higher in the COVID period (p = 0.027). CONCLUSION: Radiological diagnosis of AA was more frequent during the COVID period. More conservative management for AA was employed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and for those managed operatively an open approach was preferred. Intra-operative findings were suggestive of delayed presentation during the COVID period without this affecting the length of hospital stay."
65,10092020097036,"OBJECTIVE: Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan City, China, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic. However, no special therapeutic drugs have been identified for COVID-19. The aim of this study was to search for drugs to effectively treat COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study with a total of 162 adult inpatients (≥18 years old) from Ruijin Hospital (Shanghai, China) and Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China) between January 27, 2020, and March 10, 2020. The enrolled COVID-19 patients were first divided into the Lianhuaqingwen (LHQW) monotherapy group and the LHQW + Arbidol combination therapy group. Then, these two groups were further classified into moderate and severe groups according to the clinical classification of COVID-19. RESULTS: The early combined usage of LHQW and Arbidol can significantly accelerate the recovery of patients with moderate COVID-19 by reducing the time to conversion to nucleic acid negativity, the time to chest CT improvement, and the length of hospital stay. However, no benefit was observed in severe COVID-19 patients treated with the combination of LHQW + Arbidol. In this study, both Arbidol and LHQW were well tolerated without serious drug-associated adverse events. CONCLUSION: The early combined usage of LHQW and Arbidol may accelerate recovery and improve the prognosis of patients with moderate COVID-19."
66,10072020076292,"The crash of two 737 MAX passenger aircraft in late 2018 and early 2019, and subsequent grounding of the entire fleet of 737 MAX jets, turned a global spotlight on Boeing’s practices and culture. Explanations for the crashes include: design flaws within the MAX’s new flight control software system designed to prevent stalls; internal pressure to keep pace with Boeing’s chief competitor, Airbus; Boeing’s lack of transparency about the new software; and the lack of adequate monitoring of Boeing by the FAA, especially during the certification of the MAX and following the first crash. While these and other factors have been the subject of numerous government reports and investigative journalism articles, little to date has been written on the ethical significance of the accidents, in particular the ethical responsibilities of the engineers at Boeing and the FAA involved in designing and certifying the MAX. Lessons learned from this case include the need to strengthen the voice of engineers within large organizations. There is also the need for greater involvement of professional engineering societies in ethics-related activities and for broader focus on moral courage in engineering ethics education."
67,100620200612182,"The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing epidemic of coronavirus disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome, which has spread recently worldwide. Efforts to prevent the virus from spreading include travel restrictions, lockdowns as well as national or regional quarantines throughout the international community. The major negative psychological outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic is the anxiety caused by it. The aim of the present study was to examine the level of concern and the contributions of modes of resilience, well-being and demographic attributes towards decreasing or enhancing anxiety and depression among two samples: Israeli Jews (majority group) and Israeli Arabs (minority group). These random samples included 605 Jews and 156 Arabs who participated in an internet survey. A previous study, which has been conducted in the context of terror attacks, has shown that compared to Israeli Jews, Israeli Arabs expressed a higher level of fear of war and lower levels of resilience supporting personality attributes. The results of the current study indicated a similar pattern that emerged in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: the Israeli Arabs reported a higher level of distress and a lower level of resilience and well-being."
68,10042020040282,"BACKGROUND: The formation of productive academic research groups can be difficult, especially in environments without a robust and existing research infrastructure. Idaho and Alaska, are Institutional Development Award (IDeA)-eligible states, historically receiving low levels of funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). PURPOSE/METHODS: We present a case study highlighting an academic research collaboration established across two-disciplines, three-career stages, and three-campuses utilizing distance technology. RESULTS: One lesson learned from our experiences is that regardless of position (junior or senior faculty) or time at the institution/department (new or established), it is important to reach out to others. Collaborations require conscientious effort to establish and maintain. Second, a psychologically safe space must be created, establishing trust. Lastly, in order to eliminate distractions, optimize team performance, and improve deliverables, the team must have a shared mission. Team members must recognize, appreciate, and fully utilize each other and available resources. CONCLUSION: Our experiences and lessons learned can be utilized by others to strengthen opportunities to form and grow interdisciplinary research collaborations and develop a stronger research infrastructure."

Concurrently, many notifications and guidelines have been issued from the government and academic societies. Taking optimal measures at the prefectural level as well as the national level is necessary to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Surveying and analyzing details of the incidences of infected persons in each prefecture is extremely important. This report describes the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 observed in Okayama Prefecture, followed by discussion of the direction of public health actions to be taken in the future. We reiterate the crucial importance of reinforcing and maintaining current public health measures, including rapid and detailed compilation of information related to infected persons and their surroundings, appropriate blocking of viral transmission, and early containment of infected persons, to minimize the spread of infection especially during the overlapping epidemic period of influenza in Okayama Prefecture."
71,10092020090759,"BACKGROUND: Sars-Cov-2 is one of the latest examples of an emerging infectious disease challenging the world and it is the third case, in just two decades, of “spillover”. In light of the recent outbreak (Italy is in 2nd position), it is important to evaluate people risk perception and to support the Health Authority with effective communicative actions to avoid the spread of “infodemia”/alarmism. The aim of this study is a) to study levels of perceived threat, risk perception, severity and comparative vulnerability b) to compare risk perception with other communicable/not communicable diseases; c) provide information to increase awareness/ knowledge of the disease. METHODS: We performed an Italian multicentre study from 11 February 2020 and it is still in progress. The subjects in study (general population, HCWs and university students) were enrolled through the administration of a standardized questionnaire based on Health Belief Model through CAPI and CAWI methods. The summary and inferential statistical analyses will be carried out using the R software. RESULTS: We enrolled 2495 people from 11 February until 4 March 2020. All the respondents had heard of COVID19. Only 2% didn't know any symptoms and 3% answered to all the questions correctly (mean knowledge score of 13). 48% thought that he/she could acquired COVID 19 in the next 12 months and 70% stated that their concern of the disease was high(score5). Perceived capability to avoid it was rated as good/very good by 62%. The correct mask use (WHO) was reported by 64% of the sample and 47% stated all preventive actions (2% no one). Only 22% of the sample stated all actions to be taken in case of suspected acquisition of COVID19. CONCLUSIONS: Italy is facing an epidemic that could have the potential to affect the entire national health system. It's so important to implement public health activities and surveillance systems in order to limit the spread of the disease and bad/disinformation. KEY MESSAGES: This study is the first to report on public perception of Sars-Cov-2 in all the Italy. The results indicated that the Italian population is aware of the outbreak and it is concerned about their risk. On the other hand, only half of the sample is aware about all preventive actions and not everybody knows all procedures to be taken in case of COVID 19 suspect."
72,10102020109877,"Background Ivermectin was shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in-vitro, which has led to off-label use, but clinical efficacy has not been previously described. Research Question Does ivermectin benefit hospitalized COVID-19 patients? Study Design and Methods: Charts of consecutive patients hospitalized at four Broward Health hospitals in Florida with confirmed COVID-19 between March 15 through May 11, 2020 treated with or without ivermectin were reviewed. Hospital ivermectin dosing guidelines were provided but treatment decisions were per treating physician’s discretion. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included mortality in patients with severe pulmonary involvement, extubation rates for mechanically ventilated patients, and length of stay. Severe pulmonary involvement was defined as need for FiO2 ≥50%, noninvasive ventilation, or invasive ventilation at study entry. Logistic regression and propensity score matching were used to adjust for confounders. Results 280 patients, 173 treated with ivermectin and 107 without ivermectin, were reviewed. Most patients in both groups also received hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin. Univariate analysis showed lower mortality in the ivermectin group (15.0% versus 25.2%, OR 0.52, CI 0.29-0.96, P=0.03). Mortality was also lower among ivermectin-treated patients with severe pulmonary involvement (38.8% vs 80.7%, OR 0.15, CI 0.05-0.47, p=0.001). There were no significant differences in extubation rates (36.1% vs 15.4%, OR 3.11 (0.88-11.00), p=0.07) or length of stay. After multivariate adjustment for confounders and mortality risks, the mortality difference remained significant (OR 0.27, CI 0.09-0.80, p=0.03). 196 patients were included in the propensity-matched cohort. Mortality was significantly lower in the ivermectin group (13.3% vs 24.5%, OR 0.47, CI 0.22-0.99, p<0.05); an 11.2% (CI 0.38%-22.1%) absolute risk reduction, with a number needed to treat of 8.9 (CI 4.5-263). Interpretation Ivermectin treatment was associated with lower mortality during treatment of COVID-19, especially in patients with severe pulmonary involvement. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings."
73,101420210210492,"The reduction in carbon emissions by industrial enterprises is an important means for promoting environmental protection and achieving sustainable development. To determine the impact of carbon emissions reduction on supply chain operation and financing decision-making, in this study we designed three financing strategies, i.e., bank loan financing, equity financing, and hybrid financing (a combination of bank loan financing and equity financing), for a manufacturer (leader) and a low-carbon supply chain composed of a capital-constrained retailer, constructed Stackelberg game models, solved the equilibrium results under each financing strategy using the reverse recursion method, and revealed the financing preference of the supply chain member companies through comparative analysis. The results showed that the increase in the consumers’ low-carbon preference and equity financing ratio have positive impacts on supply chain equilibrium, a result that is opposite that for the impact of the interest rate of bank loan financing; additionally, the abovementioned three factors jointly determine the profit of the manufacturer of the low-carbon supply chain, while the retailer’s profit is affected by the equity dividend ratio. Finally, we present the conditions for the financing preference of the manufacturer and the retailer. The findings of this study can provide references for low-carbon supply chain companies to make appropriate management decisions."
74,10132021012410,"This quasi-experimental study aimed to evaluate a family-based asthma self-management program, based on the individual and family self-management theory and the McMaster model of family functioning. Children aged 7 to 12 with uncontrolled asthma and their families were recruited from an outpatient pulmonary department of a university hospital in Thailand. Thirty-seven child-parent pairs were randomly assigned to three sessions for a period of two months of the family-based asthma self-management program, while 37 child-parent pairs were assigned to the control group. Data were collected at baseline and after implementation at two months by using the Childhood Asthma Control Questionnaire and the Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, and the measurement of pulmonary function was performed using peak flow meters. Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was employed to analyze the mean difference between the experimental and control groups. The results indicated significant increased asthma control status, pulmonary function, and quality of life in the children from baseline to after implementation in the experimental group that participated in the family-based asthma self-management program. Significant improvement in these three asthma health outcomes was also seen in the experimental group when compared to the control group. It was seen that the family-based asthma self-management program is useful for promoting the self-management of school-age children, enabling the control of symptoms, and enhancing health outcomes regarding asthma."
75,10142021024763,"BACKGROUND: In the pandemic of COVID-19, due to asymptomatic patients and high personnel fluidity in outpatient clinics, health care workers (HCWs) in outpatients were facing severe threat from infection. There is an urgent need for a risk assessment to recognize and prevent infection risks. PURPOSE: To establish a semi-quantitative risk assessment model on COVID-19 infections for HCWs in outpatient departments, and apply it to practices. Further to provide infection risk management strategies to reduce infection threats in the post-pandemic of COVID-19. METHODS: We used the method of Brainstorm, Literature study and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for risk factors selection and model construction, we also created corresponding indicators for each risk factors, in order to collect data in assessment practice. RESULTS: Eighteen risk factors were recognized and selected for model construction, by scatter plot, these risk factors had been classified into four parts, spanned the scopes of diagnosis and treatment, environment, personal protection and emergency handling, with specific management suggestions provided. In the practice, outpatient clinics were divided into three risk levels, 5 clinics in high risk level, 9 in medium risk level and 11 in low risk level. CONCLUSION: A proper comprehensive risk assessment model for COVID-19 infections has been successfully established. With the model, the ability to COVID-19 prevention in outpatients can be easily evaluated. The strategies on disinfection, surveillance and personal protection were also valuable references in the post-pandemic of COVID-19."
76,10172021054726,"High temperatures, harsh pH conditions, and toxic chemicals involved in the conventional synthesis and coating of silica limit the fabrication of new-generation hybrid materials immobilizing live cells and biomolecules such as enzymes and drugs. This hinders the application of inorganic-organic biohybrid materials in various fields, including bioelectronics, energy generation, and biomedicine. Silicatein, an enzyme found in siliceous sponges, catalyzes the polymerization of silica under mild conditions, that is, at room temperature and neutral pH. Silicatein was fused with a chitin-binding domain (ChBD) to selectively bind the fusion silicatein on the chitin material and with a small soluble tag called InakC, a hydrophilic protein from Pseudomonas syringae, to control the unfavorable aggregation of silicatein. The fusion silicatein was soluble in aqueous media and was successfully found to be adsorbed on the chitin material. The immobilized fusion silicatein acted as an interfacial catalyst to fabricate silica on chitin under ambient conditions. This technique can be used to fabricate inorganic-organic hybrid materials to immobilize biomolecules and can be applied to develop novel biocatalytic systems, biosensors, and tissue culture scaffolds."
77,101720210510318,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to appraise a recently developed preparedness model for the provision of oral health care during a threat such as the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspectives of oral health care providers, administrators/staff, and patients. METHODS: An exploratory qualitative inquiry via at-a-distance semi-structured interviews and group discussions engaged a purposefully selected sample of oral health care workers and patients in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Participants were asked to appraise a preparedness model by considering how to prepare for oral care during a pandemic, while answering open-ended questions about the model content and visual presentation. Interviews and group discussions occurred between April 2020 and January 2021, were audio recorded, and transcribed verbatim. An inductive coding process was used to identify themes, subthemes, and categories of information until saturation was achieved. RESULTS: Seventy-four participants, including 19 dentists, 15 dental hygienists, 10 certified dental assistants, 9 administrators, and 21 patients, suggested modifications to the recently developed preparedness model. Individual interviews (41 participants) and group discussions (33 participants in groups ranging from 2 to 9 attendees each) lasted for an average of 53 min. Eighty-four hours of audio recordings led to more than 1110 single-spaced pages of transcripts. The thematic analysis identified 82 codes, 12 categories, and four main themes: life-long learning, critical thinking, personal and professional risk, and patient-centred care. These themes were understood within provider characteristics and social and environmental contexts. Participants highlighted the need for the model to focus on information and communication, developing awareness and understanding, inferring risks, and performing oral health care during a threat such as a pandemic or disease outbreak. A modified portrayal of the model was suggested to better represent participants’ perspectives. CONCLUSION: A recently developed preparedness model for the provision of dental care during an unfolding threat like the COVID-19 pandemic was appraised and modified by oral health care workers. Future studies are warranted to evaluate the modified model for use in the event of another unfolding threat collaboratively with providers, patients and stakeholders."
78,101620210410730,"The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic underwent a rapid transition with the emergence of a dominant viral variant (from the “D-form” to the “G-form”) that carried an amino acid substitution D614G in its “Spike” protein. The G-form is more infectious in vitro and is associated with increased viral loads in the upper airways. To gain insight into the molecular-level underpinnings of these characteristics, we used microsecond all-atom simulations. We show that changes in the protein energetics favor a higher population of infection-capable states in the G-form through release of asymmetry present in the D-form inter-protomer interactions. Thus, the increased infectivity of the G-form is likely due to a higher rate of profitable binding encounters with the host receptor. It is also predicted to be more neutralization sensitive owing to enhanced exposure of the receptor binding domain, a key target region for neutralizing antibodies. These results are critical for vaccine design."
79,10092020091447,"BACKGROUND Globally, universal health coverage (UHC) has gained traction as a major health priority. In 2011, South Africa embarked on a UHC journey to ensure that everyone has access to quality healthcare services without suffering financial impoverishment. National Health Insurance (NHI) and primary healthcare (PHC) re-engineering were two vehicles chosen to reach UHC over a 14-year period (2012-2026). The first phase of health system strengthening (HSS) initiatives to improve the quality of health services in the public sector began in 2012. These HSS initiatives are still being carried out by the Department of Health in conjunction with other partners. METHODS A qualitative case study design utilising a theory of change (TOC) approach was employed. Data were collected from key informants (n = 71) during three phases: 2011-2012 (contextual mapping), 2013-2014 (Phase 1) and 2015 (Phase 2). In-depth face-to-face interviews were conducted with participants using a TOC interview guide, adapted for each phase. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. An iterative, inductive and deductive data analysis approach was utilised. Transcripts were coded with the aid of MAXQDA 2018. RESULTS Six broad themes emerged: make PHC work, transform policy development, transform policy implementation, establish public-private partnerships, transform systems and processes and adopt a systems lens. CONCLUSION A third great transition seems to be sweeping the globe, changing how health systems are organised. Actors in our study have identified this need also. Health system transformation rather than strengthening, they say, is needed to make UHC a reality. Who is listening?"
80,10112020114141,"The Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model is the cornerstone of epidemiological models. However, this specification depends on two parameters only, which implies a lack of flexibility and the difficulty to replicate the volatile reproduction numbers observed in practice. We extend the classic SIR model by introducing nonlinear stochastic transmission, to get a stochastic SIR model. We derive its exact solution and discuss the condition for herd immunity. The stochastic SIR model corresponds to a population of infinite size. When the population size is finite, there is also sampling uncertainty. We propose a state-space framework under which we analyze the relative magnitudes of the observational and stochastic epidemiological uncertainties during the evolution of the epidemic. We also emphasize the lack of robustness of the notion of herd immunity when the SIR model is time discretized."
81,10052020053541,"This comment discusses the contribution of population movement to the spread of COVID-19, with a reference to the spread of SARS 17 years ago. We argue that the changing geography of migration, the diversification of jobs taken by migrants, the rapid growth of tourism and business trips, and the longer distance taken by people for family reunion are what make the spread of COVID-19 so differently from that of SARS. These changes in population movement are expected to continue. Hence, new strategies in disease prevention and control should be taken accordingly, which are also proposed in the comment."
82,10062020065551,"As COVID-19 cases continue to increase globally, fragile health systems already facing challenges with health system infrastructure, SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic capacity, and patient isolation capabilities may be left with few options to effectively care for acutely ill patients. Haiti—with only two laboratories that can perform reverse transcriptase PCR for SARS-CoV-2, a paucity of hospital beds, and an exponential increase in cases—provides an example that underpins the need for immediate infrastructure solutions for the crisis. We present two COVID-19 treatment center designs that leverage lessons learned from previous outbreaks of communicable infectious diseases and provide potential solutions when caseload exceeds existing capacity, with and without access to SARS-CoV-2 testing. These designs are intended for settings in which health facilities and testing resources for COVID-19 are surpassed during the pandemic, are adaptable to local conditions and constraints, and mitigate the likelihood of nosocomial transmission while offering an option to care for hospitalized patients."
83,10122020122151,"The quality of green coffee beans (GCBs) is possibly affected by storage conditions. Edible polymer coatings for GCBs can help preserve flavors and improve shelf life of GCBs. This study aimed to incorporate α-tocopherol, a powerful antioxidant, in thermoplastic starch [TPS] and chitosan [TPC] and determined the best cavitation energy (960-3840 J·mL-1) using an ultrasonic probe. Then, we evaluated the incorporation of bentonite (0% and 2% m/m) and α-tocopherol (0% and 10% m/m) in the best energy cavitation/biopolymer combination. The TPS and TPC coatings demonstrated good adherence to the GCBs, measured by surface energy. The dispersion of α-tocopherol in TPC, with cavitation energy 960 J·mL-1, promoted greater stability (greater zeta potential), thereby increasing antioxidant activity by 28% compared to TPS, therefore, was selected for a second stage. Incorporation of 2% bentonite into the TPC, with 10% α-tocopherol, resulted in a 3.7 × 10-10 g·m-1·s-1·Pa-1 water vapor permeability, which is satisfactory for prevented of moisture gain during storage. The compressive load showed values of 375 N to the non-coated GCB and around 475 N with the insertion of coatings to the GCB. Thus, a TPC/α-tocopherol/bentonite combination, dispersed with 960 J·mL-1 energy, was highly effective in the development of biopolymeric coatings for the GCBs."
84,10172021055438,"The spread of COVID-19 to more than 200 countries has shocked the public. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of transmission is very important. In this paper, the COVID-19 mathematical model has been formulated, analyzed, and validated using incident data from West Java Province, Indonesia. The model made considers the asymptomatic and symptomatic compartments and decreased immunity. The model is formulated in the form of a system of differential equations, where the population is divided into seven compartments, namely Susceptible Population ( S 0 ) , Exposed Population ( E ) , Asymptomatic Infection Population ( I A ) , Symptomatic Infection Population ( Y S ) , Recovered Population ( Z ) , Susceptible Populations previously infected ( Z 0 ) , and Quarantine population ( Q ) . The results show that there has been an outbreak of COVID-19 in West Java Province, Indonesia. This can be seen from the basic reproduction number of this model, which is 3.180126127 ( R 0 > 1 ) . Also, the numerical simulation results show that waning immunity can increase the occurrence of outbreaks; and a period of isolation can slow down the process of spreading COVID-19. So if a strict social distancing policy is enforced like a quarantine, the outbreak will lessen."
85,101020201011982,"Seafood could be a solution to meet global food demand that will double by 2050. Seafood includes a wide variety of edible marine organisms, except fish and mammals. These are molluscs, crustaceans, echinoderms and algae. Like any food, seafood can involve hazards transmitted to humans through food, which affect the health of the consumer. These hazards are both biological (viruses, bacteria, parasites) and chemical (toxins, allergens, chemicals, microplastics). The exposure of populations to these hazards through seafood consumption can be notably explained by their mode of production and the dietary habits. Firstly, the sanitary quality of products reflects the quality of the aquatic environment from which they are taken, which can be contaminated by various types of pollution (faecal or chemical, chronic or accidental). The products are then handled, often treated without using additives or chemical preservatives, and finally distributed without any other means of preservation than refrigeration or freezing. Finally, the dietary habits of seafood favour exposure to certain hazards. Seafood safety must be integrated throughout the food chain, under the responsibility shared by all stakeholders. Seafood safety appears to be an emerging public health issue of global scope, because the sea does not stop at borders."
86,10142021022312,"OBJECTIVE To retrospectively review the impact of the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on services in the oral emergency room. MATERIALS AND METHODS A statistical analysis of epidemiological characteristics and the patients' diagnoses and treatments in the Emergency Department of Peking University Hospital of Stomatology during the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 compared with those in 2019 in Beijing, China. RESULTS There were fewer total visits in 2020 than in 2019 (P = 0.001), and the proportions of patients who were children, adolescents and elderly people were lower in 2020 than in 2019 (P < 0.001). The proportions of patients with acute toothache and infections were higher in 2020 than in 2019, and the proportions of patients with maxillofacial trauma and non-emergencies were lower in 2020 than in 2019 (P < 0.001). Drug treatment for acute pulpitis was used more often in 2020 than in 2019, and endodontic treatment and examination consultations were less common in 2020 than in 2019 (P = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS The outbreak of COVID-19 affected the patient population and structure of disease types and oral services in the emergency room. The number of visits to the oral emergency room and the proportions of the patients who were children, adolescents and elderly people were reduced, meanwhile the percentage of emergency cases, except trauma, and conservative treatments increased during the outbreak of COVID-19."
87,101120201111372,"The COVID-19 pandemic, with its resultant social distancing, has disrupted the delivery of healthcare for both patients and providers. Fortunately, changes to legislation and regulation in response to the pandemic allowed Emory Healthcare to rapidly implement telehealth care. Beginning in early March 2020 and continuing through the initial 2-month implementation period (when data collection stopped), clinicians received telehealth training and certification. Standard workflows created by means of a hub-and-spoke operational model enabled rapid sharing and deployment of best practices throughout the system’s physician group practice. Lean process huddles facilitated successful implementation. In total, 2,374 healthcare professionals, including 986 attending physicians, 416 residents and fellows, and 555 advanced practice providers, were trained and certified for telehealth; 53,751 new- and established-patient audio–video telehealth visits and 10,539 established-patient telephone visits were performed in 8 weeks for a total of 64,290 virtual visits. This initiative included a new COVID-19 virtual patient clinic that saw 705 patients in a 6-week period. A total of $14,662,967 was charged during this time; collection rates were similar to in-person visits. Initial patient satisfaction scores were equivalent to in-person visits. We conclude that rapid deployment of virtual visits can be accomplished through a structured, organized approach including training, certification, and Lean principles. A hub-and-spoke model enables bidirectional feedback and timely improvements, thus facilitating swifter implementation and a quick rise in patient volume. Financial sustainability is achievable, but to sustain that, telehealth requires the support of continued deregulation by legislative and regulatory bodies."

89,100920200911245,"This paper presents three data sets about the consequences of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and subjective wellbeing in Colombia for three population subgroups: adults (+18 years old), college students, and informal workers. The data was gathered using three different online surveys in Colombia, South America. Each online survey had a different collection process. For adults and informal workers, we use a snowballing sampling strategy. For college students, we use social networks and students associations’ platforms. In total 2253 individuals participated in the data collection. The surveys aims at informing policymakers and academics about the consequences of COVID-19 in the wellbeing of three population groups. The datasets available in this report includes sociodemographic variables, standardized measures of subjective wellbeing, questions concerning to the pandemic and the quarantine, and emotional closeness with friends and keen. Information of informal workers includes a wide range of information about economic outcomes, like job stability, alternative income, financial inclusion, government welfare, and consumption patterns. This paper presents descriptive and correlation analysis of the variables included in the surveys. The information of this report aims at contributing to a broader discussion, beyond the epidemiological side, of the consequences of the pandemic on the population health. This data in brief is valuable by contributing records from a country in the global South, a region where information for policymaking and academic research is usually scarce. Before the pandemic unfolded, there were reports of high subjective wellbeing in Latin America, by studying subjective wellbeing in the middle of a crisis, is possible to examine how a crisis of this dimension affects the population wellbeing and resilience."
90,10172021052357,"BACKGROUND This study aimed to reveal long-term outcomes, such as incidence of metachronous esophageal and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and overall survival rate, through long-term observation of patients with esophageal carcinoma post-endoscopic submucosal dissection. METHODS Risk of metachronous carcinogenesis was evaluated in 88 patients with intramucosal esophageal carcinoma (without history of metachronous esophageal or head and neck squamous cell carcinomas) who underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection from 2007 to 2008 and were endoscopically observed for > 3 years. Histologically, the papillary vessel is defined as the clock gear-like structure composed of capillaries directly penetrating the epithelium (starting from the lamina propria) and covering at least two-thirds of it, around which the tumor cells are arranged in a spiral pattern. RESULTS Median endoscopic follow-up period was 11.0 years. Cumulative 2-, 5-, and 10-year metachronous esophageal carcinoma rates were 11.4%, 20.6%, and 39.3%, respectively. Stepwise multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis identified multiple Lugol-voiding lesions (LVLs) as the single significant independent predictor. Cumulative 2-, 5-, and 10-year metachronous head and neck squamous cell carcinoma rates were 6.9%, 10.4%, and 19.6%, respectively. Stepwise multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis identified multiple LVLs, Brinkman index, papillary vessel, and younger age as significant predictive factors. Overall post-endoscopic submucosal dissection survival rates were 98.8% and 87.5% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. CONCLUSION Patients with a history of esophageal carcinoma remain at risk for metachronous carcinogenesis even > 5 years after endoscopic submucosal dissection. Thus, long-term follow-up is important."

92,100820200810573,"Severe COVID-19 infection results in bilateral interstitial pneumonia, often leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary fibrosis in survivors. Most patients with severe COVID-19 infections who died had developed ARDS. Currently, ARDS is treated with supportive measures, but regenerative medicine approaches including extracellular vesicle (EV)-based therapies have shown promise. Herein, we aimed to analyse whether EV-based therapies could be effective in treating severe pulmonary conditions that affect COVID-19 patients and to understand their relevance for an eventual therapeutic application to human patients. Using a defined search strategy, we conducted a systematic review of the literature and found 39 articles (2014–2020) that reported effects of EVs, mainly derived from stem cells, in lung injury models (one large animal study, none in human). EV treatment resulted in: (1) attenuation of inflammation (reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neutrophil infiltration, M2 macrophage polarization); (2) regeneration of alveolar epithelium (decreased apoptosis and stimulation of surfactant production); (3) repair of microvascular permeability (increased endothelial cell junction proteins); (4) prevention of fibrosis (reduced fibrin production). These effects were mediated by the release of EV cargo and identified factors including miRs-126, −30b-3p, −145, −27a-3p, syndecan-1, hepatocyte growth factor and angiopoietin-1. This review indicates that EV-based therapies hold great potential for COVID-19 related lung injuries as they target multiple pathways and enhance tissue regeneration. However, before translating EV therapies into human clinical trials, efforts should be directed at developing good manufacturing practice solutions for EVs and testing optimal dosage and administration route in large animal models."
93,101020201010444,"BACKGROUND: Kawasaki disease (KD) is an idiopathic systemic vasculitis that predominantly damages coronary arteries in children. Various pathogens have been investigated as triggers for KD, but no definitive causative pathogen has been determined. As KD is diagnosed by symptoms, several days are needed for diagnosis. Therefore, at the time of diagnosis of KD, the pathogen of the trigger may already be diminished. The aim of this study was to explore comprehensive pathogens in the sera at the acute stage of KD using high-throughput sequencing (HTS). METHODS: Sera of 12 patients at an extremely early stage of KD and 12 controls were investigated. DNA and RNA sequences were read separately using HTS. Sequence data were imported into the home-brew meta-genomic analysis pipeline, PATHDET, to identify the pathogen sequences. RESULTS: No RNA virus reads were detected in any KD case except for that of equine infectious anemia, which is known as a contaminant of commercial reverse transcriptase. Concerning DNA viruses, human herpesvirus 6B (HHV-6B, two cases) and Anelloviridae (eight cases) were detected among KD cases as well as controls. Multiple bacterial reads were obtained from KD and controls. Bacteria of the genera Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Delfita, Roseomonas, and Rhodocyclaceae appeared to be more common in KD sera than in the controls. CONCLUSION: No single pathogen was identified in serum samples of patients at the acute phase of KD. With multiple bacteria detected in the serum samples, it is difficult to exclude the possibility of contamination; however, it is possible that these bacteria might stimulate the immune system and induce KD."
94,10092020096328,"Objective: Obesity induced by high-fat diet (HFD) elicits white adipose tissue dysfunction. In this study, we have hypothesized that the metabolic modulator eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) combined with the antioxidant hydroxytyrosol (HT) attenuates HFD-induced white adipose tissue (WAT) alterations. Methods: C57BL/6J mice were administered with a HFD (60% fat, 20% protein, 20% carbohydrates) or control diet (CD; 10% fat, 20% protein, 70% carbohydrates), with or without EPA (50 mg/kg/day), HT (5 mg/kg/day), or both for 12 weeks. Determinations in WAT include morphological parameters, EPA and docosahexaenoic acid content in phospholipids (gas chromatography), lipogenesis, oxidative stress (OS) and inflammation markers, and gene expression and activities of transcription factors, such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-γ), nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) (p65 subunit) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) (quantitative polymerase chain reaction and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay). Results: HFD led to WAT hypertrophy in relation to PPAR-γ downregulation. WAT metabolic dysfunction was characterized by upregulation of lipogenic SREBP-1c system, mitochondrial energy metabolism depression, loss of the antioxidant Nrf2 signaling with OS enhancement, n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids depletion and activation of the pro-inflammatory NF-κB system. EPA and HT co-supplementation diminished HFD-dependent effects additively, reaching values close or similar to controls. Conclusion: Data presented strengthen the importance of combined protocols such as EPA plus HT to attenuate metabolic-inflammatory states triggered by obesity."
95,10132021014061,"Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), a family of techniques for monitoring blood volume changes, may be especially useful for widespread contactless health monitoring using face video from consumer-grade visible-light cameras. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the widespread use of protective face masks. We found that occlusions from cloth face masks increased the mean absolute error of heart rate estimation by more than 80\% when deploying methods designed on unmasked faces. We show that augmenting unmasked face videos by adding patterned synthetic face masks forces the model to attend to the periocular and forehead regions, improving performance and closing the gap between masked and unmasked pulse estimation. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to analyse the impact of face masks on the accuracy of pulse estimation and offers several novel contributions: (a) 3D CNN-based method designed for remote photoplethysmography in a presence of face masks, (b) two publicly available pulse estimation datasets acquired from 86 unmasked and 61 masked subjects, (c) evaluations of handcrafted algorithms and a 3D CNN trained on videos of unmasked faces and with masks synthetically added, and (d) data augmentation method to add a synthetic mask to a face video."

97,10062020064897,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has come with many challenges for healthcare providers and patients alike. In addition to the direct burden it has placed on societies and health systems, it had a significant impact in the care of patients with chronic diseases, as healthcare resources were deployed to fight the crisis, and major travel and social restrictions were adopted. In the field of rheumatology, this has required notable efforts from departments and clinicians to adapt to the novel status quo and assure the follow-up of patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases. In the present viewpoint, we provide a practical approach to tackle this reality. Key measures include setting up preventive team management strategies, optimising communication with patients and reorganising patient care in all its dimensions. We then anticipate the nuances of rheumatology practice as restrictive measures are progressively lifted, while an effective vaccine is still pending. This includes the need to reimpose the same strategy as further waves unfold. Finally, we look ahead and address the lessons we can incorporate into post-COVID-19 rheumatology."
98,101120201111414,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerging infectious disease that was first reported in China and has become a worldwide pandemic. Many surgical procedures are continuing to be performed during this state of pandemic as is thoracic surgery. We present six cases of tube thoracostomy in COVID-19 patients and the modifications to the routine surgical technique. METHODS: We serially attached two closed underwater drainage systems (CUDS) together and added a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter to the port of the second CUDS, because the intrapleural air, which passes through the CUDS into the air in intensive care unit (ICU), may contain high concentrations of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Second, we attached the chest drain to the first CUDS in order to prevent the spread of virus during the placement of drain into the pleural cavity. Third, just before opening the parietal pleura, ventilation was put on standby mode and the endotracheal tube was clamped to prevent viral dissemination to the environment. Fourth, we covered the incision with a gauze sponge soaked with sterile saline solution during pleural entry, to prevent viral dissemination into the environment. RESULTS: There were a total of six patients enrolled in our study. All these patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. The surgical indication for the chest tube thoracostomy was tension pneumothorax in all six patents. All patients had lung expansion defects and subcutaneous emphysema after intervention. Unfortunately, all of them succumbed to COVID-19, despite best available treatment. There was no COVID-19 infection reported in the healthcare professionals during this study. CONCLUSIONS: Thoracic surgical procedures may cause dissemination of high amounts of 2019-nCoV in the environment and thus are perhaps the most dangerous surgeries to perform. Variations in the thoracic surgical techniques are necessary in order to protect the healthcare providers from COVID-19."
99,100920200911523,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) represents a global health emergency. To improve the understanding of the systemic component of SARS-CoV-2, we investigated if viral load dynamics in plasma and respiratory samples are associated with antibody response and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in plasma samples from 14 (44%) out of 32 patients. RNAemia was detected in 5 out of 6 fatal cases. Peak IgG values were significantly lower in mild/moderate than in severe (0.6 (interquartile range, IQR, 0.4–3.2) vs. 11.8 (IQR, 9.9–13.0), adjusted p = 0.003) or critical cases (11.29 (IQR, 8.3–12.0), adjusted p = 0.042). IgG titers were significantly associated with virus Ct (Cycle threshold) value in plasma and respiratory specimens ((ß = 0.4, 95% CI (confidence interval, 0.2; 0.5), p < 0.001 and ß = 0.5, 95% CI (0.2; 0.6), p = 0.002). A classification as severe or a critical case was additionally inversely associated with Ct values in plasma in comparison to mild/moderate cases (ß = −3.3, 95% CI (−5.8; 0.8), p = 0.024 and ß = −4.4, 95% CI (−7.2; 1.6), p = 0.007, respectively). Based on the present data, our hypothesis is that the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by a primary RNAemia, as a potential manifestation of a systemic infection. Additionally, the viral load in plasma seems to be associated with a worse disease outcome."
100,10142021022474,"The biggest challenge for our society, in order to foster the sustainable circular economy, is the efficient recycling of wastes from industrial, commercial, domestic and other streams. The transition to a circular economy is the goal of the European Commission's Circular Economy Action, which was first launched in 2015. In 2020 the above action plan announced initiatives along the entire life cycle of the product, with the aim to make sustainable products the norm in the EU. Therefore, it is anticipated that the above action will result in an increase in Europe's economic competitiveness, sustainability, resource efficiency and resource security. Within this context, the suitability of ferroalumina as a raw material in the blast furnace is investigated. Ferroalumina is the product of the high-pressure filter press dewatering process of the Greek red mud generated during the production of alumina by means of the Bayer cycle. Ferroalumina is a low-cost raw material and its possible charging in the blast furnace and/or steelmaking aggregates is a step towards industrial symbiosis, where the wastes, namely by-products, of an industry or an industrial process, become the raw materials for another. In the present work the effect of ferroalumina addition as a raw material was examined by smelting ferroalumina, blast furnace-slag, lime and scrap at 1550°C in a graphite crucible and a constant slag basicity. The increase of the alumina content in the slag improves the desulfurization capacity. Moreover, the silicon exchange between slag and metal was examined. The results indicate that the alkalis' capacity of the slag increases with the addition of ferroalumina. The analysis of the finally obtained slag suggests that it could be suitable for utilization in slag-cement production."

103,10122020125158,"One of the significant complications of severe COVID-19 infections is a coagulopathy that seems to be related to the occurrence of venous and arterial thromboembolic disease. The coagulation changes mimic but are not identical to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The vast majority of patients with COVID-19 do not meet the criteria for usual forms of DIC. In addition, there seem to be features of a strong local pulmonary thrombotic microangiopathy and direct endothelial cell infection and injury by the virus that affect the coagulopathic response to severe COVID-19. It seems COVID-19 leads to a distinct intravascular coagulation syndrome that may need separate diagnostic criteria."
104,10172021052431,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Patients on chronic immunosuppressive treatments at baseline are at increased risk of opportunistic infections. These patients are at especially increased risk of morbidity and mortality during the coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. This review will focus on patients with diseases in which immunosuppression is a vital part of the treatment regimen, including those with solid organ transplants, rheumatologic disorders, sarcoidosis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We will summarize the current knowledge of immunosuppression in these diseases and the risk of contracting COVID-19. Furthermore, we will discuss if immunosuppression increases severity of COVID-19 presentation. RECENT FINDINGS Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a large number patients receiving chronic immunosuppression have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, our understanding of the immunology of SARS-CoV-2 is advancing at a rapid pace. Currently, a number of clinical trials are underway to investigate the role of immunosuppressive treatments in the management of this disease. SUMMARY Currently, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that solid organ transplant recipients on chronic immunosuppression are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19. Solid organ transplant recipients may be at increased risk for worse COVID-19 outcomes but the data are not consistent. There is evidence to suggest that patients with rheumatologic disorders or IBDs are not at increased risk of contracting COVID-19 and do not necessarily experience worse clinical outcomes. Patients with sarcoidosis are not necessarily at increased risk of COVID-19, although there is limited data available to determine if immunosuppression worsens outcomes in this population."
105,10062020062558,"Excitatory neurotransmission meditated by glutamate receptors including N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) is pivotal to brain development and function. NMDARs are heterotetramers composed of GluN1 and GluN2 subunits, which bind glycine and glutamate, respectively, to activate their ion channels. Despite importance in brain physiology, the precise mechanisms by which activation and inhibition occur via subunit-specific binding of agonists and antagonists remain largely unknown. Here, we show the detailed patterns of conformational changes and inter-subunit and -domain reorientation leading to agonist-gating and subunit-dependent competitive inhibition by providing multiple structures in distinct ligand states at 4 Å or better. The structures reveal that activation and competitive inhibition by both GluN1 and GluN2 antagonists occur by controlling the tension of the linker between the ligand-binding domain and the transmembrane ion channel of the GluN2 subunit. Our results provide detailed mechanistic insights into NMDAR pharmacology, activation, and inhibition, which are fundamental to the brain physiology."
106,10052020054548,"Bayesian analysis of publicly available time series of cases and fatalities in different geographical regions of India during April 2020 is reported. It is found that the initial apparent rapid growthin infections could be partly due to confounding factors such as initial rapid ramp-up of disease surveillance. A brief discussion is given of the fallacies which arise if this possibility is neglected. The growth after April 10 is consistent with a time independent but region dependent exponential. From this, R0 is extracted using both known cases and fatalities. The two estimates are seen to agree in many cases; for these CFR is reported. It is seen that CFR and R0 increase together. Some public health implications of this observation are discussed, including a target doubling interval if medical facilities are to remain adequate."
107,10112020113148,"As the COVID-19 pandemic poses severe threats to human life around the globe, effective risk messages are needed to warn the public and encourage recommended actions for avoiding infection, especially as steps are taken to ease physical restrictions and restart economies. The present study examines the effects of agency assignment and reference point on perceptions of SARS-CoV-2 threat and assesses key message responses, including psychological reactance, source derogation, counterarguing, and behavioral intentions. Participants (N = 207) were randomly assigned to one of four conditions crossing agency assignment (SARS-CoV-2/human) and reference point (self/self-other). Results show, relative to human agency, SARS-CoV-2 agency assignment generated significantly more psychological reactance in the form of greater perceptions of freedom threat, anger, and negative cognitions, as well as more source derogation and counterarguing. No significant effects were found for reference point, and the interaction between agency assignment and reference point was not significant. The study findings, limitations, and implications are discussed."
108,100820200810215,"Abstract Veno-Venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (VV-ECMO) is a rescue treatment for severe acute respiratory failure refractory to conventional ventilation. We examined the alterations of sublingual microcirculation in patients with SARS-CoV-2 during VV-ECMO treatment and assessed the relationship between microvascular parameters and ventilation, hemodynamics, and laboratory tests. Nine patients were included in the study and the following microcirculatory parameters were estimated: TVD 16.81 (14.46-18.6) mm/mm2; PVD 15.3 (14.09-17.96) mm/mm2; PPV 94.85% (93.82%-97.79%); MFI 2.5 (2.5-2.92); HI 0.4 (0.18-0.4). TVD and PVD were inversely related to D-dimer levels (rho=-0.667, p=0.05 and rho=-0.733, p=0.025 respectively), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (rho=-0.886, p=0.019 and rho=-0.886, p=0.019 respectively) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (rho=-0.829, p=0.042 and rho=-0.829, p=0.042 respectively). Our results showed an altered sublingual microcirculation in patients receiving VV-ECMO for severe SARS-CoV-2 and suggest a potential contribution of endothelia dysfunction to determine microvascular alteration."
109,101020201010322,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease, related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Few data are available in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study of COVID-19 patients at 11 dialysis centres in two distinct districts of France to examine the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in this population, and to determine risk factors of disease severity (defined as a composite outcome including intensive care unit admission or death) and mortality. RESULTS: Among the 2336 patients enrolled, 5.5% had confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. Of the 122 patients with a follow-up superior to 28 days, 37% reached the composite outcome and 28% died. Multivariate analysis showed that oxygen therapy on diagnosis and a decrease in lymphocyte count were independent risk factors associated with disease severity and with mortality. Chronic use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) (18% of patients) was associated with a protective effect on mortality. Treatment with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine (AZT/HCQ) (46% of patients) were not associated with the composite outcome and with death in univariate and multivariate analyses. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is a severe disease with poor prognosis in patients with ESRD. Usual treatment with ARBs seems to be protective of critical evolution and mortality. There is no evidence of clinical benefit with the combination of AZT/HCQ."
110,10162021047783,"INTRODUCTION: This is an overall review on mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs). SOURCES OF DATA: We identified studies in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, AMED, Web of Science and Google Scholar using keywords including ‘mindfulness’, ‘meditation’, and ‘review’, ‘meta-analysis’ or their variations. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: MBIs are effective for improving many biopsychosocial conditions, including depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, addiction, psychosis, pain, hypertension, weight control, cancer-related symptoms and prosocial behaviours. It is found to be beneficial in the healthcare settings, in schools and workplace but further research is warranted to look into its efficacy on different problems. MBIs are relatively safe, but ethical aspects should be considered. Mechanisms are suggested in both empirical and neurophysiological findings. Cost-effectiveness is found in treating some health conditions. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Inconclusive or only preliminary evidence on the effects of MBIs on PTSD, ADHD, ASD, eating disorders, loneliness and physical symptoms of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and respiratory conditions. Furthermore, some beneficial effects are not confirmed in subgroup populations. Cost-effectiveness is yet to confirm for many health conditions and populations. GROWING POINTS: Many mindfulness systematic reviews and meta-analyses indicate low quality of included studies, hence high-quality studies with adequate sample size and longer follow-up period are needed. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: More research is needed on online mindfulness trainings and interventions to improve biopsychosocial health during the COVID-19 pandemic; Deeper understanding of the mechanisms of MBIs integrating both empirical and neurophysiological findings; Long-term compliance and effects of MBIs; and development of mindfulness plus (mindfulness+) or personalized mindfulness programs to elevate the effectiveness for different purposes."

However, the benefits of their work are often unseen and difficult to attribute, thereby making NRAs undervalued and under-resourced, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. This paper offers three key arguments NRAs and other stakeholders can use to advocate for greater investment in regulatory systems strengthening—medical products regulation effectively safeguards public health; effective regulation improves health system’s efficiency by increasing access to affordable medical products, contributing to universal health coverage; and robust regulation strengthens local pharmaceutical manufacturing and bolsters pharmaceutical trade. NRAs’ critical role in health systems is indisputable, yet they need to better promote their value to receive the requisite resources to function effectively."
112,10162021049976,The global burden of oral cancer rests on India's shoulders. Distant metastasis and extensive loco-regional spread result in a dismal 5-year prognosis. Tobacco chewing is the leading etiological factor. A lack of education among the masses combined with an inundated cancer care system account for high morbidity and mortality rates. The SARS-CoV-2 shows tropism for the oral mucosa. This viral tropism is thought to get augmented in oral cancer because of the upregulation of oral mucosal receptors and enzymes which enhance viral attachment and entry. The COVID-19 disease has caused a heavy blow to the cancer care sector in India because of paucity of COVID-19 centred health care regulations. This review highlights the need for the prompt creation of a national health policy which would prioritize and allow for the resumption of oral onco-surgical in light of COVID-19 pandemic.
113,101620210410056,"Electrospinning has been used to develop and upscale polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers as effective aerosol filtration materials for their potential use in respirators. The fibers were deposited onto non-woven spunbond polypropylene (SPP) and the basis weight (grammage, g/m(2)) was varied to assess the resulting effect on filtration efficiency and breathing resistance of the materials. The results indicated that a basis weight in excess of 0.4 g/m(2) of PAN electrospun fibers yielded a filtration efficiency over 97%, with breathing resistance values that increased proportionally with the amount of basis weight added. With the aim of retaining filter efficiency whilst lowering breathing resistance, the basis weight of 0.4 g/m(2) and 0.8 g/m(2) of PAN electrospun fibers were strategically split up and stacked with SPP in different configurations. The results suggested that a symmetric structure based on SPP/PAN/PAN/SPP was the optimal structure, as it reduces SPP consumption while maintaining an FFP2-type of filtration efficiency, while reducing breathing resistance, specially at high air flow rates, such as those mimicking FFP2 exhalation conditions. The incorporation of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles within the electrospun nanofibers in the form of nanocomposites, retained the high filtration characteristics of the unfilled filter, while exhibiting a strong bactericidal capacity, even after short contact times. This study demonstrates the potential of using the symmetric splitting of the PAN nanofibers layer as a somewhat more efficient configuration in the design of filters for respirators."
114,10132021013068,"Five years ago, the Melanoma Research Foundation (MRF) conducted an assessment of the challenges and opportunities facing the melanoma research community and patients with melanoma. Since then, remarkable progress has been made on both the basic and clinical research fronts. However, the incidence, recurrence and death rates for melanoma remain unacceptably high and significant challenges remain. Hence, the MRF Scientific Advisory Council and Breakthrough Consortium, a group that includes clinicians and scientists, reconvened to facilitate intensive discussions on thematic areas essential to melanoma researchers and patients alike - prevention, detection, diagnosis, metastatic dormancy and progression, response and resistance to targeted and immune-based therapy, and the clinical consequences of COVID-19 for melanoma patients and providers. These extensive discussions helped to crystalize our understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing the broader melanoma community today. In this report, we discuss the progress made since the last MRF assessment, comment on what remains to be overcome and offer recommendations for the best path forward."
115,10092020091321,"PURPOSE To study the efficacy, stability, safety and predictability of small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) at 1 day and 3 months postoperatively for moderate and high myopic astigmatism. To describe a simple and convenient method for detection and manual compensation of cyclotorsion during the procedure. METHODS In this retrospective study, a total of 164 eyes from 114 patients over 20 years of age with at least 1.5 diopters (D) of myopic astigmatism were treated by SMILE. Any cyclotorsion was manually compensated by gently rotating the cone to align the horizontal marks on the cornea to the 0° to 180° axis of the reticule after activating the suction. RESULTS The mean preoperative spherical equivalent (SE) was -5.3±2.01 D, and the mean cylinder was -2.01±0.67 D. Three months after surgery, a total of 87% of eyes were within±0.50 D of attempted post-operative SE, and 98% of eyes were within±1.00 D. Overall, the predictability of cylinder correction was excellent, with 96.3% of eyes within±1.00 D of attempted post-operative cylinder. The mean postoperative cylinder at three months was -0.3±0.39 D. We noted a slight undercorrection with treatment of high cylinder. However, 82% of eyes achieved postoperative refractive astigmatism less than 0.5 D. 91% of eyes achieved uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) equal to or better than 8/10. 22% of eyes gained one line of visual acuity. CONCLUSION SMILE is a predictable and safe technique for the surgical correction of astigmatism. Manual compensation may be an effective approach to improve astigmatic outcomes of SMILE, especially in moderate and high astigmatism."

Patients reported no travel history and shared no obvious epidemiological linkage. A search of online databases identified 12 additional B.1.1.220 with E484K, all of which were detected in New York since December 2020. Detailed genomic analyses suggests that the mutation has emerged independently in at least two different B.1.1.220 strains in this region."
117,10072020070185,"BACKGROUND: Streptococcosis and Motile Aeromonad Septicemia (MAS) are important diseases of tilapia, Oreochromis spp. and causes huge economic losses in aquaculture globally. The feed-based vaccination may be an alternative to minimize major infectious diseases in tilapia. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the haemato-immunological responses and effectiveness of a newly developed feed-based killed bivalent vaccine against Streptococcus iniae and Aeromonas hydrophila in hybrid red tilapia. A total of 495 hybrid red tilapia of 61.23 ± 4.95 g were distributed into 5 groups (each with triplicate). The fish were immunized orally through bivalent (combined S. iniae and A. hydrophila) spray vaccine (BS group), bivalent formulate vaccine (BF group), monovalent S. iniae vaccine (MS group), monovalent A. hydrophila vaccine (MA group) and unvaccinated as a control group. The vaccine was orally administered on days 0, 14 and 42 applied feed-based bacterin at 5% body weight. The blood and spleen samples were collected from all groups on 7, 21 and 49 days post-vaccination, and also 96 h post-infection to assess their haemato-immune responses. RESULTS: Compared with the unvaccinated group, leukocyte, lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes counts in vaccinated groups were significantly (P < 0.05) increased on 21, 49 days post-vaccination and also 96 h post-infection, while erythrocytes, haemoglobin and haematocrit in vaccinated groups were significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced only 96 h post-infection. Additionally, the lysozyme and phagocytic activity and, serum antibody (IgM) were significantly higher (P < 0.05) against S. iniae and A. hydrophila in vaccinated groups compared to the unvaccinated group in the pre- and post-infection. Results from the challenge through co-infection with S. iniae and A. hydrophila showed the relative percent survival (RPS) in BF group was 76.67 ± 4.71%, which had the capacity to induce significant protection (P < 0.05) compared to others groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the bivalent formulate (BF) group could elicit significant non-specific and specific immunological responses with higher protection in hybrid red tilapia. In addition, this newly developed feed-based bivalent vaccination can be a promising technique for effective and large scale fish immunization in the aquaculture industry."
118,10042020046195,"Abstract The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an illness caused due to Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared this outbreak a global health emergency and as on April 24, 2020, it has spread to 213 countries, with 25,91,015 confirmed cases and 742,855 cases have been recovered from COVID-19. In this dreadful situation our team has already published an article in the Science of the Total Environment, which elaborates the various aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this situation, it is imperative to understand the possible outcome of COVID-19 recovered patients and determine if they have any other detrimental illnesses by longitudinal analysis to safeguard their life in future. It is necessary to follow-up these recovered patients and performs comprehensive assessments for detection and appropriate management towards their psychological, physical, and social realm. This urges us to suggest that it is highly important to provide counselling, moral support as well as a few recommended guidelines to the recovered patients and society to restore to normalcy. Epidemiological, clinical and immunological studies from COVID-19 recovered patients are particularly important to understand the disease and to prepare better for potential outbreaks in the future. Longitudinal studies on a larger cohort would help us to understand the in-depth prognosis as well as the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Also, follow-up studies will help us provide more information for the development of vaccines and drugs for these kinds of pandemics in the future. Hence, we recommend more studies are required to unravel the possible mechanism of COVID-19 infection and the after-effects of it to understand the characteristics of the virus and to develop the necessary precautionary measures to prevent it."
119,10102020101595,"Ubiquitous, situated, and physical visualizations create entirely new possibilities for tasks contextualized in the real world, such as doctors inserting needles. During the development of situated visualizations, evaluating visualizations is a core requirement. However, performing such evaluations is intrinsically hard as the real scenarios are safety-critical or expensive to test. To overcome these issues, researchers and practitioners adapt classical approaches from ubiquitous computing and use surrogate empirical methods such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) prototypes, or merely online demonstrations. This approach's primary assumption is that meaningful insights can also be gained from different, usually cheaper and less cumbersome empirical methods. Nevertheless, recent efforts in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community have found evidence against this assumption, which would impede the use of surrogate empirical methods. Currently, these insights rely on a single investigation of four interactive objects. The goal of this work is to investigate if these prior findings also hold for situated visualizations. Therefore, we first created a scenario where situated visualizations support users in do-it-yourself (DIY) tasks such as crafting and assembly. We then set up five empirical study methods to evaluate the four tasks using an online survey, as well as VR, AR, laboratory, and in-situ studies. Using this study design, we conducted a new study with 60 participants. Our results show that the situated visualizations we investigated in this study are not prone to the same dependency on the empirical method, as found in previous work. Our study provides the first evidence that analyzing situated visualizations through different empirical (surrogate) methods might lead to comparable results."
120,10052020053227,"BACKGROUND A possible association between COVID-19 infection and thrombosis, either as a direct consequence of the virus or as a complication of inflammation, is emerging in the literature. Data on the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) are extremely limited. METHODS We describe three cases of thromboembolism refractory to heparin treatment, the incidence of VTE in an inpatient cohort, and a case-control study to identify risk factors associated with VTE. RESULTS We identified 274 confirmed (208) or probable (66) COVID-19 patients. 21 (7.7%) were diagnosed with VTE. D-dimer was elevated in both cases (confirmed VTE) and controls (no confirmed VTE) but higher levels were seen in confirmed VTE cases (4.1 vs 1.2 μg/mL, P<0.001). CONCLUSION Incidence of VTE is high in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Urgent clinical trials are needed to evaluate the role of anticoagulation in COVID-19. Monitoring of D-dimer and anti-factor Xa levels may be beneficial in guiding management."
121,10112020114627,"Recent research suggests that extreme heat affects the demand for emergency services, including police and fire department incidents. Yet there is limited understanding of impacts across U.S. cities, with varying population sizes, and between different climates. This study sought to examine the daily utilization of police and fire department services, during hot days in 23 U.S. cities representing six climate zones using relative risk (RR) and time series analyses of daily police and fire department incidents. The warm season analyses utilized three temperature metrics: daily maximum temperature (T(MAX)), daily maximum heat index (HI(MAX)), and the preceding daily minimum temperature (T(MIN)). Across these cities, the RR of police department incidents on days where T(MAX) was at or above the 95th percentile significantly increased within a range from 3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.3%, 6.3%) to 57% (95% CI: 24.5%, 89.7%), compared with a nonhot day. At the same temperature thresholds, the RR of fire department dispatches increased from 6% (95% CI: 3.0%, 8.6%) to 18% (95% CI: 15.2%, 21.6%). These results remained consistent across temperature metrics and consecutive days of extreme heat. The estimated effects of daily maximum temperature, daily maximum heat index, and daily minimum temperature were nonlinear for police and fire department incidents across all cities. These findings inform climate change adaptation strategies, preparing budgets and personnel for emergency agencies to ensure resilience as periods of extreme heat increase in frequency, severity, and duration."
122,10122020122637,"This article describes why a constitutional test that relies exclusively on history and tradition for deciding modern firearm regulations is woefully inadequate when applied to modern technologies. It explains the unique advancements in firearm technology - specifically, ghost guns - that challenge the viability of a purely historical test, even if legal scholars or judges attempt to reason by analogy. This article argues that the prevailing, two-step approach, which incorporates both history and tradition, and requires a judicial examination of the purposes and methods supporting a challenged firearm regulation, should apply nationwide. That a dissenting faction of conservative judges seeks to ignore the prevailing approach presents a potentially dangerous path for Second Amendment jurisprudence. This article draws from certain historical gun laws to illustrate the difficult legwork that analogies must do under a purely historical test. It uses the advent of ghost guns as a case study to offer guidance for judges in their rulemaking practices regarding Second Amendment cases."
123,10062020065237,"BACKGROUND: Recent reports indicate racial disparities in the rates of infection and mortality from the 2019 novel coronavirus (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]). The aim of this study was to determine whether disparities exist in the levels of knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAPs) related to COVID-19. METHODS: We analyzed data from 1216 adults in the March 2020 Kaiser Family Foundation ‘Coronavirus Poll’, to determine levels of KAPs across different groups. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was used to identify predictors of KAPs. RESULTS: In contrast to White respondents, Non-White respondents were more likely to have low knowledge (58% versus 30%; P < 0.001) and low attitude scores (52% versus 27%; P < 0.001), but high practice scores (81% versus 59%; P < 0.001). By multivariate regression, White race (odds ratio [OR] 3.06; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.70–5.50), higher level of education (OR 1.80; 95% CI: 1.46–2.23) and higher income (OR 2.06; 95% CI: 1.58–2.70) were associated with high knowledge of COVID-19. Race, sex, education, income, health insurance status and political views were all associated with KAPs. CONCLUSIONS: Racial and socioeconomic disparity exists in the levels of KAPs related to COVID-19. More work is needed to identify educational tools that tailor to specific racial and socioeconomic groups."

125,10082020084093,"Numerous studies are published on the benefits of electric hand dryers vs paper towels (PT) for drying hands after washing. Data are conflicting and lacking key variables needed to assess infection risks. We provide a rapid scoping review on hand-drying methods relative to hygiene and health risks. Controlled vocabulary terms and keywords were used to search PubMed (1946-2018) and Embase (1947-2018). Multiple researchers independently screened abstracts for relevance using predetermined criteria and created a quality assessment scoring system for relative study comparisons. Of 293 papers, 23 were included in the final analysis. Five studies did not compare multiple methods; however, 2 generally favoured electric dryers (ED); 7 preferred PT; and 9 had mixed or statistically insignificant results (among these, 3 contained scenarios favourable to ED, 4 had results supporting PT, and the remaining studies had broadly conflicting results). Results were mixed among and within studies and many lacked consistent design or statistical analysis. The breadth of data does not favour one method as being more hygienic. However, some authors extended generalizable recommendations without sufficient scientific evidence. The use of tools in quantitative microbial risk assessment is suggested to evaluate health exposure potentials and risks relative to hand-drying methods. We found no data to support any human health claims associated with hand-drying methods. Inconclusive and conflicting results represent data gaps preventing the advancement of hand-drying policy or practice recommendations."

127,100520200511690,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is causing a huge toll on individuals, families, communities and societies across the world. Currently, whether wearing facemasks in public should be a measure to prevent transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains contraversial.1 This is largely because there have been no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for coronavirus to directly support this. However, lessons may be taken from published RCTs examining influenza-like illness (ILI).2,3 Recent studies suggested that SARS-CoV-2 shares similar transmission route with influenza virus,4 and the incidence of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in individuals with ILI is high.5 Therefore, we undertook this meta-analysis of RCTs examining the efficacy of wearing facemasks to prevent ILI in community settings, irrespective of confirmatory testing for the causative virus. We undertook a systematic literature search for RCTs related to facemasks and ILI between 1966 and April 2020 using PUBMED, EMBASE, and Cochrane library. RCTs undertaken in community (not hospital) settings comparing wearing and not wearing facemasks for ILI were included. Incidence of ILI (e.g., fever, cough, headache, sore throat, aches or pains in muscles or joints) was estimated per group. Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. We screened 899 related abstracts and eventually included 8 RCTs (Figure S1). Basic characteristics and quality of included RCTs are listed in Supplement. Participants wearing facemasks had a significantly lower risk of developing ILI than those not wearing facemasks (pooled RR=0.81, 95% CI: 0.70-0.95) and there was no heterogeneity (Figure 1). The decreased risk of ILI was more pronounced if everyone wore facemask irrespective of whether they were infected or not (RR=0.77, 95% CI: 0.65-0.91), compared to those wearing facemasks when infected (RR=0.95, 95% CI: 0.58-1.56) or uninfected (RR=1.26, 95% CI: 0.69-2.31). This study shows that wearing facemasks, irrespective of infection status, is effective in preventing ILI spread in the community. This situation mirrors what is happening now in public settings where we do not know who has been infected and who has not. Although there are no RCTs of facemasks for SARS-CoV-2, as with other simple measures such as social distancing and handwashing, these data support the recommendation to wear facemasks in public to further reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and flatten the curve of this pandemic, especially when social distancing is impractical, such as shopping, or travelling with public transport for work that cannot be done from home."
128,10132021012376,"ABSTRACT The clinical manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated pneumonia show a wide range of variations. It ranges from mild hypoxemia without significant signs of respiratory distress, to rapid clinically deteriorating course with severe hypoxemia. Unexplained severe hypoxemia, associated with platypnea, triggers the possibility of ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, ranging from intrapulmonary shunts (IPS) to alveolar dead space ventilation. In the literature, very few cases with COVID-19-pneumonia have been reported with IPS. Herein, we report a COVID-19 confirmed 45-year male patient, who developed IPS without apparent pulmonary perfusion defect on lung perfusion scintigraphy. The patient had no cardiovascular disease except chronic pulmonary hypertension secondary to interstitial lung disease. The clinical manifestations combined with nuclear imaging features enabled in making the ultimate diagnosis. The patient's clinical condition improved on appropriate clinical management, using high flow oxygen combined with intravenous steroids and anticoagulants. Key Words: COVID-19, Adult respiratory distress syndrome, Right to left shunt, Lung perfusion scintigraphy, Platypnea."

Most research in this area is based on questionnaires and focuses on long-term conditions. The few studies that focused on physical examination in video consultations indicated that it poses challenges for the participants. The specific activity of wound assessment through video in post-surgery consultations has never been studied yet. Also, comparative analysis of the face-to-face and video-setting on the moment-to-moment organization of such an activity is original. OBJECTIVE The objective of our study was to examine the impact of video technology on the workings of assessments of post-surgery wounds and its limits. METHODS We recorded 22 post-operative video consultations and 17 post-operative face-to-face consultations. The primary purpose of the consultation was informing the patient about the final pathology results of the resected specimen and the secondary purpose was checking on the patient's recovery, including an assessment of the closed wound. The recordings were transcribed in detail and analyzed using methods of Conversation Analysis. RESULTS The way in which an assessment of the wound is established in video consultations differs from the procedure in face-to-face consultations. In the consultation room, wound assessments overwhelmingly (15 out of 17) involve wound showings in the context of which surgeons report their observations formatted with evidentials (""looks neat"") and subsequently assess what these observations imply or what can be concluded from them. In contrast, wound assessments in video consultations do not tend to involve showing the wound (3 out of 22) and, given the technological restrictions, do not involve palpation. Rather, the surgeon invites the patient to assess the wound, which opens up a sequence of patient and physician assessments in which diagnostic criteria like redness or swollenness are made explicit. In contrast to observations in regular consultations, these assessments are characterized by epistemic markers of uncertainty (""I think"", ""sounds… good"") and evidentials are absent. Even in case of a potential wound problem, the surgeon may reside in questioning the patient rather than requesting a showing. CONCLUSIONS The impact of the video technology on post-operative consultations is that a conclusive wound assessment is arrived at in a different way compared to face-to-face consultations. In video consultations, physicians inquire and patients provide their own, ""lay"" observations, which serve as the basis for the assessment. This means that in video consultations patients have a fundamentally different role. These talking-based assessments are effective unless, in case of a potential problem, patient answers seem insufficient and a showing might be beneficial. The findings are expected to be generalizable to other healthcare areas, e.g., dermatology, physiotherapy. CLINICALTRIAL"
133,10062020064129,"In this study we estimate the heart rate from face videos for student assessment. This information could be very valuable to track their status along time and also to estimate other data such as their attention level or the presence of stress that may be caused by cheating attempts. The recent edBBplat, a platform for student behavior modelling in remote education, is considered in this study1. This platform permits to capture several signals from a set of sensors that capture biometric and behavioral data: RGB and near infrared cameras, microphone, EEG band, mouse, smartwatch, and keyboard, among others. In the experimental framework of this study, we focus on the RGB and near-infrared video sequences for performing heart rate estimation applying remote photoplethysmography techniques. The experiments include behavioral and physiological data from 25 different students completing a collection of tasks related to e-learning. Our proposed face heart rate estimation approach is compared with the heart rate provided by the smartwatch, achieving very promising results for its future deployment in e-learning applications."
134,10122020123529,"OBJECTIVES In June 2020, Arizona had the fastest-growing number of cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide. As part of the growing public health response, the University of Arizona Student Aid for Field Epidemiology Response (SAFER) team was able to modify and increase case investigation efforts to assist local health departments. We outline the recommended logistical and management steps to include students in a public health response of this scope. METHODS From April 1 through September 1, 2020, the SAFER team identified key components of a successful student team response: volunteer training, management that allows more senior students to manage newer students, adoption of case-management software, and use of an online survey platform for students to conduct interviews consistently and allow for data quality control and management. RESULTS From April 1 through September 1, 2020, SAFER worked with 3 local health departments to complete 1910 COVID-19 case investigations through a virtual call center. A total of 233 volunteers and 46 hourly student workers and staff members were involved. As of September 2020, students were completing >150 interviews per week, including contact-tracing efforts. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS Developing relationships between applied public health and academic programs can relieve the burden of low-risk, high-volume case investigations at local and state health departments. Furthermore, by establishing a virtual call center, health sciences faculty and students can volunteer remotely during a pandemic with no additional risk of infection."
135,10172021054040,"There is an ongoing and established need for humanitarian training and professionalization. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted training programs designed to accomplish this goal, including the Humanitarian Response Intensive Course, which includes a three-day immersive simulation to prepare humanitarian workers for future field work. To provide program continuity, the three day simulation was quickly adapted to a virtual format using a combination of video conferencing, short messaging service, and cloud-based file storage software. Participants were geographically dispersed and participated virtually. Learning objectives were preserved while some components not amenable to a virtual format were removed.A virtual humanitarian training simulation is a feasible, acceptable, and affordable alternative to an in-person simulation. Participants were engaged and experienced minimal technological disruptions. The majority of students felt the format met or exceeded expectations. However, feedback also emphasized the importance of providing sufficient time for team collaboration and deliverable preparation in the simulation schedule. The virtual format was more affordable than the traditional in-person simulation and diverse expert faculty who could not have attended in-person were able to participate. This format could be used to overcome other barriers to in-person simulation training, including geographic, financial, time, or security."
136,10112020115539,"The childhood obesity pandemic has emerged as an important public health problem in many countries. Obese children are likely to become obese adults, and adult obesity is associated with an increased risk of morbidity. Therefore, controlling the childhood obesity epidemic has become a top public health priority worldwide. The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may significantly impede this important mission and constitute an unprecedented tragedy in the global battle against childhood obesity. This manuscript presents evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic will aggravate the childhood obesity epidemic and lead to significant weight gain in school children by creating an unprecedented obesogenic environment. Within the last few months, many countries took uncompromising measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including school closures and quarantine. While these steps are often necessary to ensure infection control, they may have a significant negative effect on children's mental and physical health. Physical, nutritional, and psychosocial factors that promote obesity in children during this special situation complementarily contribute to an unprecedented obesogenic environment. Large-scale quarantine and home confinement will impose new and unfamiliar stressors on children, thereby worsening the childhood obesity epidemic. Most importantly, adverse childhood events resulting from a predicted increase in domestic violence within the next few months will significantly contribute to this concern. The scenario presented in this review is of paramount public health importance and must be considered during future pandemic planning. Involved stakeholders, including governments, schools, and families, must make all possible efforts to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on childhood obesity."
137,10052020052139,"BACKGROUND The use of patient-facing health technologies to manage long-term conditions is increasing; however, children and young people may have particular concerns or needs before deciding to use different health technologies. AIMS To identify children and young people's reported concerns or needs in relation to using health technologies to self-manage long-term conditions. METHODS A scoping review was conducted. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINAHL in February 2019. Searches were limited to papers published between January 2008 and February 2019. We included any health technology used to manage long-term conditions. A thematic synthesis of the data from the included studies was undertaken. We engaged children with long-term conditions (and parents) to support review design, interpretation of findings and development of recommendations. RESULTS Thirty-eight journal articles were included, describing concerns or needs expressed by n=970 children and/or young people aged 5-18 years. Most included studies were undertaken in high-income countries with children aged 11 years and older. Studies examined concerns with mobile applications (n=14), internet (n=9), social media (n=3), interactive online treatment programmes (n=3), telehealth (n=1), devices (n=3) or a combination (n=5). Children and young people's main concerns were labelling and identity; accessibility; privacy and reliability; and trustworthiness of information. DISCUSSION This review highlights important concerns that children and young people may have before using technology to self-manage their long-term condition. In future, research should involve children and young people throughout the development of technology, from identifying their unmet needs through to design and evaluation of interventions."
138,10112020112256,"INTRODUCTION The global burden of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease pandemic on the healthcare system, as well as the high transmission risk of coronavirus disease has led to the use of alternative strategies for evaluation of children with chronic conditions. In this context, telemedicine has become the effective and affordable choice. In this study we aimed to evaluate the efficiency of telephone visits to determine pulmonary exacerbations and hospitalization rates of children with cystic fibrosis and interstitial lung disease. METHODS A total of 119 children with cystic fibrosis or interstitial lung disease were enrolled and provided cases in which telephone visits were applied during the peak time of the coronavirus disease pandemic in our country. The recordings of respiratory, gastrointestinal and other symptoms, nutrition status, rate of acute pulmonary exacerbation, treatments initiated by telephone visits, referral to hospital and hospitalization were established from the electronic health reports of the patients. RESULTS Thirteen patients (10.9%) were symptomatic, 12 of them (10%) were diagnosed with acute pulmonary exacerbation. One patient was diagnosed with peripheral facial paralysis. Nine patients were recalled to the hospital and seven patients (5.8%) were hospitalised. DISCUSSION Using telemedicine the health status of patients can be defined, and patients can be guided on proper healthcare that they need, especially during the times of pandemics which we are facing. Communication with patients while minimising the risk of exposure to coronavirus disease is an important advantage of telemedicine. Telemedicine will have to be implemented on our daily medical practice in the near future."
139,10052020055656,"A prothrombotic coagulopathy is commonly found in critically ill COVID‐19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A unique feature of COVID‐19 respiratory failure is a relatively preserved lung compliance and high Alveolar‐arterial oxygen gradient, with pathology reports consistently demonstrating diffuse pulmonary microthrombi on autopsy, all consistent with a vascular occlusive etiology of respiratory failure rather than the more classic findings of low‐compliance in ARDS. The COVID‐19 pandemic is overwhelming the world’s medical care capacity with unprecedented needs for mechanical ventilators and high rates of mortality once patients progress to needing mechanical ventilation, and in many environments including in parts of the United States the medical capacity is being exhausted. Fibrinolytic therapy has previously been used in a Phase 1 clinical trial that led to reduced mortality and marked improvements in oxygenation. Here we report a series of three patients with severe COVID‐19 respiratory failure who were treated with tissue plasminogen activator. All three patients had a temporally related improvement in their respiratory status, with one of them being a durable response."
140,10062020063646,"Studies aimed at characterizing the evolution of COVID-19 disease often rely on case-based surveillance data publicly released by health authorities, that can be incomplete and prone to errors. Here, we quantify the biases caused by the use of inaccurate data in the estimation of the Time-Varying Reproduction Number R(t). By focusing on Italy and Spain, two of the hardest-hit countries in Europe and worldwide, we show that if the symptoms' onset time-series is inferred from the notification date series, the R(t) curve cannot capture nor describe accurately the early dynamics of the epidemic. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the containment measures that were implemented, such as national lockdowns, can be properly evaluated only when R(t) is estimated using the real time-series of dates of symptoms' onset. Our findings show that extreme care should be taken when a pivotal quantity like R(t) is used to make decisions and to evaluate different alternatives."
141,10122020124246,"The Retromer complex (Vps35-Vps26-Vps29) is essential for endosomal membrane trafficking and signalling. Mutations in Retromer cause late-onset Parkinson’s disease, while viral and bacterial pathogens can hijack the complex during cellular infection. To modulate and probe its function we have created a novel series of macrocyclic peptides that bind Retromer with high affinity and specificity. Crystal structures show the majority of cyclic peptides bind to Vps29 via a Pro-Leu-containing sequence, structurally mimicking known interactors such as TBC1D5, and blocking their interaction with Retromer in vitro and in cells. By contrast, macrocyclic peptide RT-L4 binds Retromer at the Vps35-Vps26 interface and is a more effective molecular chaperone than reported small molecules, suggesting a new therapeutic avenue for targeting Retromer. Finally, tagged peptides can be used to probe the cellular localisation of Retromer and its functional interactions in cells, providing novel tools for studying Retromer function."
142,10092020098463,"Cells have evolved highly specialized sentinels that detect viral infection and elicit an antiviral response. Among these, the stress-sensing protein kinase R, which is activated by double-stranded RNA, mediates suppression of the host translation machinery as a strategy to limit viral replication. Non-translating mRNAs rapidly condensate by phase separation into cytosolic stress granules, together with numerous RNA-binding proteins and components of signal transduction pathways. Growing evidence suggests that the integrated stress response, and stress granules in particular, contribute to antiviral defense. This review summarizes the current understanding of how stress and innate immune signaling act in concert to mount an effective response against virus infection, with a particular focus on the potential role of stress granules in the coordination of antiviral signaling cascades."
143,10132021015419,"To determine if boys with acute testicular torsion, a surgical emergency requiring prompt diagnosis and treatment to optimize salvage of the testicle, delayed presentation to a medical facility and experienced an extended duration of symptoms (DoS), and secondarily, a higher rate of orchiectomy, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: Single-center, descriptive retrospective chart review of boys presenting with acute testicular torsion from March 15, to May 4, 2020 (“during COVID-19” or group 2), as well as for the same time window in the 5-year period from 2015 to 2019 (“pre–COVID-19” or group 1). RESULTS: A total of 78 boys met inclusion criteria, group 1 (n = 57) and group 2 (n = 21). The mean age was 12.86 ± 2.63 (group 1) and 12.86 ± 2.13 (group 2). Mean DoS before presentation at a medical facility was 23.2 ± 35.0 hours in group 1 compared with 21.3 ± 29.7 hours in group 2 (P < 0.37). When DoS was broken down into acute (<24 hours) versus delayed (≥24 hours), 41 (71.9%) of 57 boys in group 1 and 16 (76.2%) of 21 boys in group 2 presented within less than 24 hours of symptom onset (P < 0.78). There was no difference in rate of orchiectomy between group 1 and group 2 (44.7% vs 25%, P < 0.17), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Boys with acute testicular torsion in our catchment area did not delay presentation to a medical facility from March 15, to May 4, 2020, and did not subsequently undergo a higher rate of orchiectomy."
144,10092020097750,"BACKGROUND: Widespread adoption, use, and integration of patient-facing technologies into the workflow of health care systems has been slow, thus limiting the realization of their potential. A growing body of work has focused on how best to promote adoption and use of these technologies and measure their impacts on processes of care and outcomes. This body of work currently suffers from limitations (eg, cross-sectional analyses, limited patient-generated data linked with clinical records) and would benefit from institutional infrastructure to enhance available data and integrate the voice of the patient into implementation and evaluation efforts. OBJECTIVE: The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has launched an initiative called the Veterans Engagement with Technology Collaborative cohort to directly address these challenges. This paper reports the process by which the cohort was developed and describes the baseline data being collected from cohort members. The overarching goal of the Veterans Engagement with Technology Collaborative cohort is to directly engage veterans in the evaluation of new VHA patient-facing technologies and in so doing, to create new infrastructure to support related quality improvement and evaluation activities. METHODS: Inclusion criteria for veterans to be eligible for membership in the cohort included being an active user of VHA health care services, having a mobile phone, and being an established user of existing VHA patient-facing technologies as represented by use of the secure messaging feature of VHA’s patient portal. Between 2017 and 2018, we recruited veterans who met these criteria and administered a survey to them over the telephone. RESULTS: The majority of participants (N=2727) were male (2268/2727, 83.2%), White (2226/2727, 81.6%), living in their own apartment or house (2519/2696, 93.4%), and had completed some college (1176/2701, 43.5%) or an advanced degree (1178/2701, 43.6%). Cohort members were 59.9 years old, on average. The majority self-reported their health status as being good (1055/2725, 38.7%) or very good (524/2725, 19.2%). Most cohort members owned a personal computer (2609/2725, 95.7%), tablet computer (1616/2716, 59.5%), and/or smartphone (2438/2722, 89.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The Veterans Engagement with Technology Collaborative cohort is an example of a VHA learning health care system initiative designed to support the data-driven implementation of patient-facing technologies into practice and measurement of their impacts. With this initiative, VHA is building capacity for future, rapid, rigorous evaluation and quality improvement efforts to enhance understanding of the adoption, use, and impact of patient-facing technologies."
145,101520210310904,"Infrared thermal imaging (IRI) is a contact-less technology able to monitor human skin temperature for biomedical applications and in real-life contexts. Its capacity to detect fever was exploited for mass screening during past epidemic emergencies as well as for the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, the only assessment of fever may not be selective for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Hence, novel approaches for IRI data analysis have been investigated. The present review aims to describe how IRI have been employed during the last epidemics, highlighting the potentialities and the limitations of this technology to contain the contagions. Specifically, the methods employed for automatic face recognition and fever assessment and IRI’s performances in mass screening at airports and hospitals are reviewed. Moreover, an overview of novel machine learning methods for IRI data analysis, aimed to identify respiratory diseases, is provided. In addition, IRI-based smart technologies developed to support the healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic are described. Finally, relevant guidelines to fully exploit IRI for COVID-19 identification are defined, to improve the effectiveness of IRI in the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 infection."
146,100820200812402,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a fatal epizootic swine coronavirus that presents a financial threat to the global swine industry. Since the discovery of the low-pathogenic genotype 1b (G1b) in 2014, it has been responsible for sporadic outbreaks in South Korea. In this study, we identified novel G1b variants arising from the natural recombination of a major pandemic-like G2b virus and a minor G1b virus currently circulating in the domestic field. The whole-genome sequences of two 2018–19 G1b recombinants, KNU-1808 and KNU-1909, were determined. A genomic comparison showed that these two viruses share the highest nucleotide sequence similarity with the 2017 G1b strain but share less similarity with the 2014 G1b emergent strain KNU-1406. However, the putative recombination breakpoints spanning the first 1,170 nucleotides of the spike (S) gene were almost identical among the emergent and contemporary G1b strains. Recombination detection indicated that the inter-subgroup G1b recombinant first emerged in 2017 by introducing the N-terminal domain of S from KNU-1406 into the backbone of KNU-1703, possibly leading to antigenic shift. It then evolved into KNU-1808 and KNU-1909 through genetic drift, moving toward a more G2b-like genotype. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the 2018–2019 G1b recombinants belong to a cluster containing other G1b strains but form a new branch. This study provides an important advance warning in regard to the emergence and prevalence of new genotypes or variants that can result from genetic recombination between two different PEDV genotypes circulating in endemic areas and continuous non-lethal mutations essential for viral fitness in the host environment.

147,101020201012535,"In a recent report, the British Broadcasting Company (BBC) introduced South Korea’s measures to manage COVID-19 as role model for the world. Screening centers serve as frontiers for preventing community transmission of infectious diseases. COVID-19 screening centers in Korea operate 24 h a day, always open for individuals with suspected COVID-19 symptoms. South Korea concentrated COVID-19 screening centers around cities with high population density. Advanced screening centers (models C, D, and E) proved more effective and efficient in the prevention of COVID-19 than the traditional screening centers (models A and B). Particularly, screening centers at Incheon Airport in South Korea prevent transmission through imported cases effectively. It will be important elsewhere, as in South Korea, to establish an infectious disease delivery system that can lead to 'Test-Treat-Track' using an adequate model of screening centers."
148,10162021045194,"Automatic diagnosis of coronavirus (COVID-19) is studied in this research. Deep learning methods especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great success in COVID-19 diagnosis in recent works. But they are efficient when the depth of network is high enough. However, the use of a deep network requires a sufficiently large training set, which is not available in practice. From the other hand, the use of a shallow CNN may not provide superior results because it is not able to rich feature extraction due to lacking enough convolutional layers. To deal with this difficulty, the contextual features reduced by convolutional filters (CFRCF) is proposed in this work. CFRCF extracts shape and textural features as contextual feature maps from the chest X-ray radiographs and abdominal computed tomography (CT) images. Morphological operators, Gabor filter banks and attribute filters are used for contextual feature extraction. Then, two convolutional filters are applied to the contextual feature cube to extract the nonlinear sub-features and hidden relationships among the contextual features. Finally, a fully connected layer is used to produce a reduced feature vector which is fed to a classifier. Support vector machine and random forest are used as classifier. The experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed method from the recognition accuracy and running time point of view using limited training samples. More than 76% and 94% overall classification accuracy is obtained by the proposed method in CT scan and X-ray images datasets, respectively."
149,10012020010069,"To investigate the evolution of lung function in preterm infants with and without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and to determine the perinatal characteristics associated with indexes of lung function in later infancy. Longitudinal lung function assessments were performed at approximately 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of corrected age in preterm infants. Perinatal characteristics were further analyzed to ascertain the determinants of lung function indexes. Although all preterm infants (n = 121; 61 without BPD and 60 with BPD) exhibited decreased lung function in early infancy (6 months of age), after body length was adjusted for, only infants with BPD exhibited poor performance. Furthermore, the lung function of infants with mild to moderate BPD caught up gradually, but the generally poor lung function performance of infants with severe BPD, especially in forced expiratory flow, persisted until later age (24 months). Regarding perinatal characteristics, the z-score of body length at the time of examination and total number of days on positive-pressure ventilation are the major determinants of lung function in later infancy."

In the absence of a “gold standard” treatment, the rapid development of a safe and effective vaccine is considered the most promising way to control the pandemic. In recent years, traditional vaccine technologies have seemed insufficient to provide global protection against the rapid spread of emerging pandemics. Therefore, the establishment of novel approaches that are independent of whole pathogen cultivation, cost-effective, and able to be rapidly developed and produced on a large scale are of paramount importance for global health. This article summarizes the current efforts to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, including the ongoing and future anticipated clinical trials. We also provide plastic and reconstructive surgeons with insight into the novel technologies currently utilized for COVID-19 vaccine development, focusing on the very promising viral-vector-based and gene-based vaccine technologies. Each platform has its own advantages and disadvantages related to its efficacy and ability to induce certain immune responses, manufacturing capacity, and safety for human use. Once the fundamental key challenges have been addressed for viral-vector-based and gene-based vaccines, these novel technologies may become helpful in winning the fight against COVID-19 and transforming the future of health care."
153,10142021020263,"Imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam (Recarbrio™) is an intravenously administered combination of the carbapenem imipenem, the renal dehydropeptidase-I inhibitor cilastatin, and the novel β-lactamase inhibitor relebactam. Relebactam is a potent inhibitor of class A and class C β-lactamases, conferring imipenem activity against many imipenem-nonsusceptible strains. Imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam is approved in the USA and EU for the treatment of hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP) and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP) in adults and other gram-negative infections, including complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs) [including pyelonephritis] and complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs), in adults with limited or no alternative treatment options. In pivotal phase II and III trials, imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam was noninferior to piperacillin/tazobactam in patients with HABP/VABP and to imipenem/cilastatin in patients with cUTIs and cIAIs. It was also effective in imipenem-nonsusceptible infections. Imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam was generally well tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with that of imipenem/cilastatin. Available evidence indicates that imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam is an effective and generally well tolerated option for gram-negative infections in adults, including critically ill and/or high-risk patients, and a potential therapy for infections caused by carbapenem-resistant pathogens."
154,10132021019223,"BACKGROUND: The venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a frequent condition, which may worsen the prognosis of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Nevertheless, the incidence of this complication is unknown in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms. CASE SUMMARY: A 26-year-old female nurse, who had been taking oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) treatment for the last 2 years, developed mild COVID-19 symptoms (rhinitis and anosmia). She underwent isolation at home and was subsequently followed up with telehealth visits. Fifteen days after her initial presentation, she developed acute onset sudden dyspnoea. On physical examination, she was found to be tachycardic with normal pulse oximetry. The initial risk score for VTE was moderate and laboratory results showed increased D-dimer level without other relevant findings. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography was performed, which confirmed low-risk subsegmental pulmonary embolism. DISCUSSION: Venous thromboembolism in patients who present with severe COVID-19 symptoms has already been described in the literature; its incidence is greater in patients hospitalized in intensive care units. Efforts to prevent VTE based on risk scores are widely recognized. However, the relationship in patients who present with mild COVID-19 symptoms and VTE is still unknown. Recently, experts on this field have introduced thromboprophylaxis guidelines including ambulatory patients based on the severity of COVID-19 symptoms and pro-thrombotic risk. Our patient showed no major risk for developing VTE; therefore, the VTE could be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection or the eventual pro-thrombotic association with the concomitant use of OCPs."
155,10172021050226,"BACKGROUND: Late diagnoses of HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C are important public health problems that affect the population at large and migrants in particular. Missed opportunities of HIV and hepatitis screening are numerous, with language differences being a significant barrier to testing. Several studies have shown that migrants who do not speak the language of the health provider are less likely to get tested, due to health providers’ reluctance to offer a test and to migrants’ reluctance to accept testing. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study is to develop a multilingual electronic tool (app) that assists health providers in offering and explaining HIV and hepatitis screenings to migrants with a language barrier and to evaluate its acceptability and impact in terms of public health. METHODS: The study will go through 3 stages: (1) concept development, (2) app development, and (3) app evaluation. A qualitative study has been undertaken to explore language barriers during health care encounters and their effect on communication, specifically when a screening test is offered. In parallel, a systematic review of the literature was conducted to have a comprehensive overlook of electronic tools designed to help health care providers communicate with migrants with a language barrier. To generate a list of items to be translated for inclusion in the app, we will conduct a focus group and Delphi survey. The development of the app will include translation and voice recording of items. The electronic development will also include 3 steps of user testing. The acceptability of the app will be evaluated using the System Usability Scale. Evaluation of the app’s efficacy will consist of a stepped wedge randomized controlled trial. The study will be carried out in 16 centers that treat migrants and offer them screening tests for infectious diseases. The primary outcome is the percentage of screening tests realized. The secondary outcomes are the rate of screening proposal by health professionals, acceptance rate by migrants, number of positive cases using this app, and frequency of use of the app. RESULTS: The app evaluation study received a 3-year grant from the Agence Nationale de la Recherche contre le SIDA et les hépatites virales (ANRS) and from the Office Français de l’Immigration et Intégration (OFII). At the time of publication of this protocol, the initial qualitative study and systematic literature review were completed. CONCLUSIONS: This study will develop an app that assists health providers in offering and explaining HIV and hepatitis screenings to migrants with a language barrier and measure its acceptability and effectiveness in terms of public health. When completed, this app could be distributed to numerous professionals carrying out screening with migrant populations in various health care settings.

156,10082020088871,"BACKGROUND: The ongoing pandemic of Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has created a global emergency. Despite the infection causes a mild illness to most people, some patients are severely affected, demanding an urgent need to better understand how to risk-stratify infected subjects. DESIGN: This is a meta-analysis of observational studies evaluating cardiovascular (CV) complications in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and the impact of cardiovascular risk factors (RF) or comorbidities on mortality. METHODS: Data sources: PubMed, Scopus, and ISI from 1 December 2019 through 11 June 2020; references of eligible studies; scientific session abstracts; cardiology web sites. We selected studies reporting clinical outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The main outcome was death. Secondary outcomes were cardiovascular symptoms and cardiovascular events developed during the COVID-19-related hospitalization. Extracted data were recorded in excel worksheets and analysed using statistical software (MedCalc, OpenMetanalyst, R). We used the proportion with 95% CI as the summary measure. A Freeman-Tukey transformation was used to calculate the weighted summary proportion under the random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed by using the Cochran Q test and I(2) values. RESULTS: Among 77317 hospitalized patients from 21 studies, 12.86% had cardiovascular comorbidities or RF. Cardiovascular complications were registered in 14.09% of cases during hospitalization. At meta-regression analysis, pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities or RF were significantly associated to cardiovascular complications in COVID-19 patients (p = 0.019). Pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities or RF (p<0.001), older age (p<0.001), and the development of cardiovascular complications during the hospitalization (p = 0.038) had a significant interaction with death. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular complications are frequent among COVID-19 patients, and might contribute to adverse clinical events and mortality, together with pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities and RF. Clinicians worldwide should be aware of this association, to identifying patients at higher risk."
157,10052020051430,"The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) represents a network of implantable or wearable medical devices that continuously collect medical data about the patient’s health status. These data are heavy, sensitive and require high level of security. With the emergence of blockchain technology, researchers are focusing on using blockchain strategies to bring security to healthcare applications. However, such integration is very difficult and challenging due to the different requirements in these two technologies. We present in this paper a technical review of existing solutions applying blockchain technology on IoMT. We analyze these studies, discuss the proposed architectures and how they managed the integration challenges. The open issues regarding the application of blockchain over IoMT are also specified."
158,10112020116030,"CONTEXT: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, NHS England prohibited people visiting acute hospital trusts. An end-of-life companion scheme was introduced to support the delivery of care for seriously unwell and dying patients during this time. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to capture the companions’ experience and activities, including qualitative feedback, as well as outline recommendations for this role in future services and training. METHODS: The companions’ service comprised Allied Healthcare Professionals working for the trust who volunteered for the role following a reduction in their normal workload due to COVID-19. They worked in shifts covering a 12-hour period every day of the week with patients identified by the palliative care team. Companions completed questionnaires containing a 4 domains mixture of Likert scale and free text responses before and after their experience. Details of the visits were recorded in daily spreadsheets. RESULTS: The majority of companions were from the physiotherapy team with a range of experience working in the NHS. In total, 64 patients were seen over 382 visits. The companions often carried out more than one activity per visit including communication with the patient and next of kin, personal care, literature, and spirituality. Data showed a statistically significant association between experience as a companion and reduced anxiety around spending time with dying people. CONCLUSION: This study highlights an interesting approach to changing job roles for health-care professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as recognizing the importance of allied health professionals in the multidisciplinary approach to palliative and end-of-life care."
159,10172021057549,"BACKGROUND: Within one year after its emergence, more than 108 million people acquired SARS-CoV-2 and almost 2·4 million succumbed to COVID-19. New SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC) are emerging all over the world, with the threat of being more readily transmitted, being more virulent, or escaping naturally acquired and vaccine-induced immunity. At least three major prototypic VoC have been identified, i.e. the United Kingdom, UK (B.1.1.7), South African (B.1.351) and Brazilian (B.1.1.28.1) variants. These are replacing formerly dominant strains and sparking new COVID-19 epidemics. METHODS: We studied the effect of infection with prototypic VoC from both B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants in female Syrian golden hamsters to assess their relative infectivity and virulence in direct comparison to two basal SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated in early 2020. FINDINGS: A very efficient infection of the lower respiratory tract of hamsters by these VoC is observed. In line with clinical evidence from patients infected with these VoC, no major differences in disease outcome were observed as compared to the original strains as was quantified by (i) histological scoring, (ii) micro-computed tomography, and (iii) analysis of the expression profiles of selected antiviral and pro-inflammatory cytokine genes. Noteworthy however, in hamsters infected with VoC B.1.1.7, a particularly strong elevation of proinflammatory cytokines was detected. INTERPRETATION: We established relevant preclinical infection models that will be pivotal to assess the efficacy of current and future vaccine(s) (candidates) as well as therapeutics (small molecules and antibodies) against two important SARS-CoV-2 VoC. FUNDING: Stated in the acknowledgment."
160,101220201210277,"Wastewater based epidemiology (WBE) has emerged as a reliable strategy to assess the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Recent publications suggest that SARS-CoV-2 detection in wastrewater is technically feasible; however, many different protocols are available and most of the methods applied have not been properly validated. To this end, different procedures to concentrate and extract inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and surrogates were initially evaluated. Urban wastewater seeded with gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and mengovirus (MgV) was used to test the concentration efficiency of an aluminum hydroxide adsorption-precipitation method and a polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation protocol. Moreover, two different RNA extraction methods were compared in this study: a commercial manual spin columns centrifugation kit and an automated protocol based on magnetic silica beads. Overall, the evaluated concentration methods did not impact the recovery of gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 nor MgV, while extraction methods showed significant differences for PEDV. Mean recovery rates of 42.9 ± 9.5%, 27.5 ± 14.3% and 9.0 ± 2.2% were obtained for gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2, PEDV and MgV, respectively. Limits of detection (LoD95%) for five genomic SARS-CoV-2 targets (N1, N2, gene E, IP2 and IP4) ranged from 1.56 log genome equivalents (ge)/mL (N1) to 2.22 log ge/mL (IP4) when automated system was used; while values ranging between 2.08 (N1) and 2.34 (E) log ge/mL were observed when using column-based extraction method. Different targets were also evaluated in naturally contaminated wastewater samples with 91.2%, 85.3%, 70.6%, 79.4% and 73.5% positivity, for N1, N2, E, IP2 and IP4, respectively. Our benchmarked comparison study suggests that the aluminum precipitation method coupled with the automated nucleic extraction represents a method of acceptable sensitivity to provide readily results of interest for SARS-CoV-2 WBE surveillance."
161,10122020120020,"The present work aimed to assess the chondroprotective influence of chitosan and lecithin in a monoiodoacetate (MIA)-induced experimental osteoarthritis (OA) model. Forty male rats weighing 180–200 g were randomly distributed among the following five experimental groups (eight per group): control, MIA-induced OA, MIA-induced OA + chitosan, MIA-induced OA + lecithin, and MIA-induced OA + chitosan + lecithin. The levels of TNF-α, IL6, RF, ROS, and CRP, as well as mitochondrial markers such as mitochondrial swelling, cytochrome C oxidase (complex IV), MMP, and serum oxidative/antioxidant status (MDA level) (MPO and XO activities) were elevated in MIA-induced OA. Also, SDH (complex II) activity in addition to the levels of ATP, glutathione (GSH), and thiol was markedly diminished in the MIA-induced OA group compared to in control rats. These findings show that mitochondrial function is associated with OA pathophysiology and suggest that chitosan and lecithin could be promising potential ameliorative agents in OA animal models. Lecithin was more effective than chitosan in ameliorating all of the abovementioned parameters."
162,10062020067420,"BACKGROUND: Laboratory tests and transfusions are sometimes ordered inappropriately, particularly in the critical care setting, which sees frequent use of both. Audit and Feedback (A&F) is a potentially useful intervention for modifying healthcare provider behaviors, but its application to the complex, team-based environment of critical care is not well understood. We conducted a systematic review of the literature on A&F interventions for improving test or transfusion ordering in the critical care setting. METHODS: Five databases, two registries, and the bibliographies of relevant articles were searched. We included critical care studies that assessed the use of A&F targeting healthcare provider behaviors, alone or in combination with other interventions to improve test and transfusion ordering, as compared to historical practice, no intervention, or another healthcare behaviour change intervention. Studies were included only if they reported laboratory test or transfusion orders, or the appropriateness of orders, as outcomes. There were no restrictions based on study design, date of publication, or follow-up time. Intervention characteristics and absolute differences in outcomes were summarized. The quality of individual studies was assessed using a modified version of the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Cochrane Review Group’s criteria. RESULTS: We identified 16 studies, including 13 uncontrolled before-after studies, one randomized controlled trial, one controlled before-after study, and one controlled clinical trial (quasi-experimental). These studies described 17 interventions, mostly (88%) multifaceted interventions with an A&F component. Feedback was most often provided in a written format only (41%), more than once (53%), and most often only provided data aggregated to the group-level (41%). Most studies saw a change in the hypothesized direction, but not all studies provided statistical analyses to formally test improvement. Overall study quality was low, with studies often lacking a concurrent control group. CONCLUSIONS: Our review summarizes characteristics of A&F interventions implemented in the critical care context, points to some mechanisms by which A&F might be made more effective in this setting, and provides an overview of how the appropriateness of orders was reported. Our findings suggest that A&F can be effective in the context of critical care; however, further research is required to characterize approaches that optimize the effectiveness in this setting alongside more rigorous evaluation methods.

163,10082020086684,"Background: Depression and anxiety affect up to 20% of new and expectant mothers during the perinatal period; this rate may have increased due to COVID-19 and lockdown measures. This analysis aimed to assess how mothers are feeling and coping during lockdown, and to identify the potential pathways that can assist them. Methods: 1329 women living in the UK aged [≥]18 years with an infant [≤]12 months of age completed an anonymous online survey. Descriptive analysis of maternal mental health, coping, support received, activities undertaken and consequences of lockdown was conducted. Linear regression was used to predict maternal mental health and coping, using activities, support, and consequences of the lockdown as predictors, while adjusting for age, gestational age, ethnicity, income, marital status and number of children. Results: More than half of the participants reported feeling down (56%), lonely (59%), irritable (62%) and worried (71%), to some or high extent since lockdown began. Despite this, 70% felt able to cope with the situation. Support with her own health (95% CI .004, .235), contacting infant support groups (95% CI -.003, .252), and higher infant gestational age (95% CI .000, .063) predicted better mental health. Travelling for work (95% CI -.680, -.121), lockdown having a major impact on the ability to afford food (95% CI -1.202, -.177), and having an income lower than 30k (95% CI -.475, -.042) predicted poorer mental health. Support with her own health and more equal division of household chores were associated with better coping. Conclusion: During lockdown, a large proportion of new mothers experienced symptoms of poor mental health; mothers of infants with lower gestational age, with low income, and who are travelling to work were particularly at risk. However, greater support for maternal health and with household chores showed positive associations with maternal mental health and coping. These findings highlight the urgent need to assess maternal mental health, and to identify prevention strategies for mothers during different stages of lockdown."

166,10062020068713,"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic transformed the personal and professional lives of radiology trainees. The purpose of this study was to broadly summarize the impact COVID-19 on radiology trainees and their training programs via data collected during the early pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: : An online survey was distributed to radiology chief residents in residencies throughout North America with responses collected between March 20th, 2020 and May 15th, 2020, which coincided with the development of initial COVID-19 peaks in North America. A subset of COVID-19 pandemic questions included resident wellness, imaging opinions, residency infrastructure change, and opinions regarding the Core Exam delay. RESULTS: : 140 chief residents from 86 institutions responded to COVID-19-related questions. Nearly all responding programs (99%; 85/86) reported institutional positive cases of COVID-19. Most residents (94%; 132/140) thought laboratory testing provided more value than imaging. 57% of respondents (80/140) would use COVID-19-related terminology when encountering chest CT findings supportive of viral pneumonia in symptomatic patients. There was little reported change in the number of residents on call (no change reported in >80% of programs). 59% of residents (83/140) reported increased stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of programs (93%) had fewer residents on service (80/86 responding programs). CONCLUSIONS: : COVID-19 dramatically affected radiology residencies during the early pandemic period. As we enter future phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, careful thought should also be given to rebuilding the radiology resident experience."
167,10112020119303,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a leading cause of pneumonia and death. The aim of this investigation is to identify the key genes in SARS-CoV-2 infection and uncover their potential functions. We downloaded the expression profiling by high throughput sequencing of GSE152075 from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Normalization of the data from primary SARS-CoV-2 infected samples and negative control samples in the database was conducted using R software. Then, joint analysis of the data was performed. Pathway and Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses were performed, and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, target gene - miRNA regulatory network, target gene - TF regulatory network of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were constructed using Cytoscape software. Identification of diagnostic biomarkers was conducted using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. 994 DEGs (496 up regulated and 498 down regulated genes) were identified. Pathway and GO enrichment analysis showed up and down regulated genes mainly enriched in the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, Ribosome, response to external biotic stimulus and viral transcription in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Down and up regulated genes were selected to establish the PPI network, modules, target gene - miRNA regulatory network, target gene - TF regulatory network revealed that these genes were involved in adaptive immune system, fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis, influenza A and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum. In total, ten genes (CBL, ISG15, NEDD4, PML, REL, CTNNB1, ERBB2, JUN, RPS8 and STUB1) were identified as good diagnostic biomarkers. In conclusion, the identified DEGs, hub genes and target genes contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the advancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection and they may be used as diagnostic and molecular targets for the treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the future."

169,10042020044782,"The COVID-19 pandemic has increased demand for ventilators. Anaesthetic machines offer an alternative, but these are not designed to run continuously. Our department uses Dräger Primus anaesthetic machines which require daily checks. Dräger company representatives have indicated that checks can be deferred for up to 72 h [1], but this might increase the risk of malfunctions. Checks take several minutes, so an alternative means of ventilation is required to cover this period, necessitating two circuit disconnections per patient. Each disconnection potentially generates an infectious aerosol, and risks tracheal tube displacement and lung derecruitment, even with precautions such as tracheal tube clamping. We concluded that multiple circuit disconnections were unsatisfactory and devised a process for daily checks with a single disconnection per patient. We call this process 'domino switching'."
170,10102020103382,"INTRODUCTION The pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus virus has altered all facets of clinical practice in the United States. The goal of this study is to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on rhinologic ambulatory and operative practice. METHODS A 27-item survey to assess these objectives was created and approved by the Division of Rhinology faculty at Rush University Medical Center in April 2020. The survey was then distributed to rhinologists in a web based format via www.surveymonkey.com from April 10 through April 23, 2020. RESULTS A total of 277 U.S based rhinologists responded to the survey (23.04%). The most common practice types were single specialty private (44.9%) and academic (24.6%). 90.2% practice in a state under a shelter in place order. Comparing pre-COVID baseline to during-COVID, there was statistically significant reduction in the number of patients of seen daily in clinic (p < 0.001). The number of nasal endoscopies in the office and surgical procedures fell dramatically. Overall, 5 respondent rhinologists have been infected with COVID-19 and 27 have been furloughed. CONCLUSION COVID-19 has drastically affected rhinologic practice. There is a dramatic reduction of in person care in the office setting and surgical management of sinonasal and skull base disease. Enhanced PPE is being used in only half of potentially aerosolizing procedures which represents an area of further education. Novel approaches such as use of virtual encounters and point of care testing should be considered as options to facilitate care."
171,10142021026612,"The rampant spread of COVID-19, an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, all over the world has led to over millions of deaths, and devastated the social, financial and political entities around the world. Without an existing effective medical therapy, vaccines are urgently needed to avoid the spread of this disease. In this study, we propose an in silico deep learning approach for prediction and design of a multi-epitope vaccine (DeepVacPred). By combining the in silico immunoinformatics and deep neural network strategies, the DeepVacPred computational framework directly predicts 26 potential vaccine subunits from the available SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence. We further use in silico methods to investigate the linear B-cell epitopes, Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL) epitopes, Helper T Lymphocytes (HTL) epitopes in the 26 subunit candidates and identify the best 11 of them to construct a multi-epitope vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 virus. The human population coverage, antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity, physicochemical properties and secondary structure of the designed vaccine are evaluated via state-of-the-art bioinformatic approaches, showing good quality of the designed vaccine. The 3D structure of the designed vaccine is predicted, refined and validated by in silico tools. Finally, we optimize and insert the codon sequence into a plasmid to ensure the cloning and expression efficiency. In conclusion, this proposed artificial intelligence (AI) based vaccine discovery framework accelerates the vaccine design process and constructs a 694aa multi-epitope vaccine containing 16 B-cell epitopes, 82 CTL epitopes and 89 HTL epitopes, which is promising to fight the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and can be further evaluated in clinical studies. Moreover, we trace the RNA mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 and ensure that the designed vaccine can tackle the recent RNA mutations of the virus."
172,101220201211169,"While studies indicate differences in incidence and case fatality risk of COVID-19, few efforts have shed light on regional variations in the intensity of initial community spread. We conducted a nationwide study using county-level data on COVID-19 from Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. We characterized intensity of initial community COVID-19 attack by calculating the incidence and case fatality risk (CFR) for the first 4-week period of COVID-19 spread in each county. We used multivariate multilevel multinomial logistic regression to estimate the association of county-level characteristics with COVID-19 incidence and CFR. Of 3,143 counties, we included 1,052 with at least 100 reported cases on June 1st. Median incidence was 193.4 per 100,000 population (IQR: 94.2-397.5). Median case fatality risk was 3.6% (IQR: 1.4â€“7.3). Median age, rural population, population density, lower education, uninsured population, obesity, COPD prevalence were positively associated, while population, female sex, races (Asian, white), higher education, excessive drinking were negatively associated with initial COVID-19 incidence. Median age, female sex, Asian race, population density, higher education, excessive drinking, Intensive Care Unit beds, airborne infection isolation rooms were positively associated, while Hispanic ethnicity, lower education, obesity (paradox), uninsured population were negatively associated with initial COVID-19 CFR."
173,10172021056657,"Background: To analyze the correlation between clinical course and radiographic development on computed tomography (CT) in patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to provide more evidence for treatment. Methods: This retrospective, observational, cohort study enrolled 49 patients with Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed COVID-19, which included 30 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Third Hospital and 19 patients either admitted to or receiving telemedicine consultation from Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Xuhui Dahua Hospital, and hospitals in other provinces. CT scans were performed in all enrolled patients and the radiographic features including simple ground-glass opacities (GGOs), GGO with interlobular septal thickening, consolidations with GGO, and consolidations only were monitored by repeating the CT. The progression of these radiographic features was analyzed in combination with their clinical staging and the time interval between onset of symptoms to CT. Results: Based on illness severity, the 49 patients were classified into four stages: mild (n = 6), moderate (n = 12), severe (n = 16), and critically ill (n = 15). The CT findings were classified into three phases: early (n = 5), progression (n = 39), and recovery (n = 5). Among the 49 patients, 9 had bilateral diffuse GGO or diffuse consolidations (white lungs) and were counted as 18 lesions. Three patients had no abnormal findings on initial CT, but their repeat CT showed new lesions. In all, we identified 892 lesions including simple GGO, GGO with interlobular septal thickening, consolidations with GGO, and consolidations only. Conclusions: Most patients had pulmonary lesions on the posterior, inferior, and peripheral lung fields on CT. The development of GGO with interlobular septal thickening, GGO with consolidations, and consolidations only happened mainly between days 8 and 14. The emergence of consolidations may suggest the progression to the severe phase of the illness, whereas simple consolidations or “white lung” may suggest a critically ill phase."

This study aims to assess childhood obesity prevention policies in Iran through a policy analysis of agenda-setting using Kingdon’s multiple streams. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted using in-depth interviews with 39 key informants and document review from different stages of the policymaking process of childhood and adolescent obesity prevention programs in Iran. The analysis of documents and interviews were guided based on Kingdon’s multiple streams (problem, policy and political streams). RESULTS: The important factors of the problem stream were the high prevalence of childhood and adolescent obesity and its risk factors in Iran. In the policy stream, a focus on preventing non-communicable diseases in the health system, increasing the workforce in health centers, promoting health school programs, and creating healthy eating buffets in schools was identified. Under the political stream, the impact of the WHO ECHO program in 2015 and the implementation of the health system transformation plan in Iran in the new government took place after 2013, caused the Iran ECHO program entered the agenda and implemented from 2016. CONCLUSIONS: Now that a window of opportunity for childhood and adolescent obesity prevention policymaking has been created, the problems such as the therapeutic approach in the health system, the existence of sanctions against Iran and outbreak of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), have hindered the successful implementation of this policy and the opportunity window has not been well used.

175,10112020111987,"Background: The corona virus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) imposed new public health constraints that deterred people from coming to the hospital. The outcome of patients who developed appendicitis during mandated COVID-19 quarantine has yet to be examined. The main objective was to establish whether there was an increased rate of perforated appendicitis seen during COVID-19 quarantine. Secondary objectives included observing the type of procedure performed, length of stay, and associated complications. Materials and Methods: This retrospective analysis was designed to look at the rates of appendicitis and perforated appendicitis observed during mandatory ""safer at home order"" from March to May 2020. The same time period a year earlier was used for comparative analysis. The study utilized data gathered from a single health care system, which consisted of a large regional referral center with three emergency rooms (ERs). Patients were included in the study if they presented to any ER in our health care system with a chief complaint of acute appendicitis. Perforated appendicitis was determined either radiographically or intraoperatively. Interventions included surgery, percutaneous drainage, or medical management. Results: There were 107 patients who were included. During quarantine, a total of 48 patients presented with acute appendicitis, with 16 perforations, compared with the previous year where 59 patients presented with acute appendicitis, with 10 perforations (33% versus 17% P = .04). Most patients underwent laparoscopic appendectomy (91%, n = 98), six patients (6%) were managed with intravenous antibiotics and 3 patients (3%) with percutaneous drainage. Patients who perforated had a longer duration of symptoms (2 versus 1, P = .03), white blood cell count (13,190 versus 15,960 cells/mm3, P = .09), and longer operative time (72 versus 89 minutes, P = .01). Patients who perforated had an increased length of stay and rate of complication. Conclusion: There was an overall increased rate of perforated appendicitis seen during quarantine compared with the previous year. Patients with perforated appendicitis had an increased length of stay, longer operative time, and increased rate of complications. Thus, although people were staying home due to public health safety orders, it negatively impacted those who developed appendicitis who may have presented to the hospital otherwise sooner."

Tigecycline evades the main tetracycline resistance genetic mechanisms, such as tetracycline-specific efflux pump acquisition and ribosomal protection, via the addition of a glycyclamide moiety to the 9-position of minocycline. The use of the parenteral form of tigecycline is approved for complicated skin and skin structure infections (excluding diabetes foot infection), complicated intra-abdominal infections, and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia in adults. New evidence also suggests the effectiveness of tigecycline for the treatment of severe Clostridioides difficile infections. Tigecycline showed in vitro susceptibility to Coxiella spp., Rickettsia spp., and multidrug-resistant Neisseria gonnorrhoeae strains which indicate the possible use of tigecycline in the treatment of infections caused by these pathogens. Except for intrinsic, or often reported resistance in some Gram-negatives, tigecycline is effective against a wide range of multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. Herein, we summarize the currently available data on tigecycline pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, its mechanism of action, the epidemiology of tigecycline resistance, and its clinical effectiveness."
179,10022020020408,"BACKGROUND Early detection of vascular compromise following free flap microsurgical reconstruction is essential. This can lead to timely reoperations and flap salvage. Both arteries and veins are monitored postoperatively with implantable ultrasound Dopplers based on surgeon preference with no consensus as to which method is best. This systematic review and meta-analysis compared arterial to venous implantable Dopplers for postoperative monitoring of microsurgical free flap reconstruction. METHODS Five databases (MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus) were systematically and independently searched. PRISMA and Cochrane guidelines were strictly followed. Clinical characteristics, donor and recipient sites, specific arterial or venous vessels, diagnostic data, outcomes, and complications were recorded. RESULTS The seven studies included in the meta-analysis were published from 1994 to 2018, with results from 38 of the possible 64 outcomes and complications queried. A total of 763 flaps with implantable Doppler probes on 527 arteries and 388 veins were included in the study. Compared to patients monitored with venous implantable Dopplers, arterial monitoring was associated with a risk of false-positives reduced by 74% (RR:0.26, 95% CI:0.12, 0.55, I2 = 40%, p = .0004) and risk of signal loss reduced by 63% (RR:0.37, 95% CI:0.24, 0.59, I2 = 26%, p < .0001). Patients being monitored with a venous implantable Doppler did not show significantly different sensitivities, specificities, true-positives, false-negatives, true-negatives, positive predictive values, negative predictive values, time to signal loss, take-backs, salvage rates, flap failures, flap failure rates, arterial, venous, vascular, and hematoma compromise compared to an arterial implantable Doppler. CONCLUSION These findings suggest arteries may be the best vessels to monitor when using an implantable Doppler following free flap microsurgical reconstruction. Caution is advised when interpreting these findings for clinical significance due to no significant differences in take-backs, SR, flap failures, and FFR."
180,10142021029521,"The emergence and global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) has resulted in an urgent need for evidence on medical interventions and outcomes of the resulting disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). Although many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating treatments and vaccines for COVID‐19 are already in progress, the number of clinical questions of interest greatly outpaces the available resources to conduct RCTs. Therefore, there is growing interest in whether nonrandomized real‐world evidence (RWE) can be used to supplement RCT evidence and aid in clinical decision making, but concerns about nonrandomized RWE have been highlighted by a proliferation of RWE studies on medications and COVID‐19 outcomes with widely varying conclusions. The objective of this paper is to review some clinical questions of interest, potential data types, challenges, and merits of RWE in COVID‐19, resulting in recommendations for nonrandomized RWE designs and analyses based on established RWE principles."
181,10092020095147,"The delayed delivery, poor fitting and discomfort of customized orthoses are reported in rehabilitation clinics as resulting in more invasive interventions. The current practice of orthosis customization relies heavily upon the experience and fabrication processes of therapists. In order to better understand the current practice, and thus identify data that is required for better comfort moving towards a data-driven customization, this paper describes a study generating working models of therapists. Customizations of hand and wrist orthoses for 18 patients were observed. Verbal protocol analysis was employed to extend the current understanding of fabrication processes. Working models of four therapists were established with quantitative evaluation on major phases, interactive activities and iterations of performing tasks during fabrication, revealing different working models between in- and out-patient departments (e.g. fabrication for in-patients was more complex and focused on ergonomic fitting whereas fabrication for out-patients paid attention to durability) which were qualitatively explained.Practitioner Summary: Fit and comfort are imperative for orthosis design and fabrication, however the current practice of customization of an orthosis relies upon the experience of individual hand therapist. The paper presents working models of hand therapists, and relevant data that would enable customization of orthosis for better fit."
182,10122020129762,"Ambient air pollution is a global health threat that causes severe mortality and morbidity from respiratory, cardiovascular, and other diseases. Its impact is especially concerning in cities; as the urban population increases, especially in low- and middle-income countries, large populations risk suffering from these health effects. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) comprises 15 West African countries, in which many cities are currently experiencing fast growth and industrialization. However, government-led initiatives in air quality monitoring are scarce in ECOWAS countries, which makes it difficult to effectively control and regulate air quality and subsequent health issues. A scoping study was performed following the Arksey and O’Malley methodological framework in order to assess the precise status of air quality monitoring, related policy, and legislation in this region. Scientific databases and gray literature searches were conducted, and the results were contrasted through expert consultations. It was found that only two ECOWAS countries monitor air quality, and most countries have insufficient legislation in place. Public health surveillance data in relation to air quality data is largely unavailable. In order to address this, improved air quality surveillance, stricter and better-enforced regulations, regional cooperation, and further research are strongly suggested for ECOWAS."

187,10172021051138,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed exceptional demands on Intensive Care Units (ICU) across the world – particularly requiring patients to be intubated and mechanically ventilated. Laryngeal injury following intubation is a common occurrence, therefore this study aims to analyse airway, voice, and swallow (AVS) outcomes of patients intubated for COVID-19 pneumonitis and compares it to intubated non-COVID-19 respiratory patients and other ICU admissions. METHOD: We collected data from inpatient records, and follow-up clinics on intubated adult patients discharged from a tertiary care hospital ICU between 01/03/20 and 30/04/20. Patients were assessed with the AVS Scale, Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10), and Eating Assessment Tool-10 (EAT-10). RESULTS: 86 patients were admitted with COVID-19 pneumonitis, 17 patients were admitted with non-COVID-19 respiratory failure, and 26 patients were admitted with a non-respiratory diagnosis. The COVID-19 cohort demonstrated higher rates of AVS difficulties (airway 59% vs 44% and 31%, voice 40% vs 19% and 19%, swallow 21% vs 6% and 12%). VHI-10 and EAT-10 scores showed no significant differences between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Patients intubated for COVID-19 pneumonitis reported higher rates of AVS difficulties against non-COVID-19 reasons for intubation. Robust prospective screening protocols are essential to improving patient outcomes by highlighting and therefore managing laryngological sequelae that occur following intubation."
188,10152021032866,"During the present Sars-CoV-2 pandemic, there has been an increase in the development of UVC disinfection systems. Researchers and members of the lighting community shifted their interests to this new field to help develop systems for disinfecting facemasks and other small equipment. In this paper we show that it is possible to use DIALux to simulate the irradiance distribution provided by a lamp emitting in the UVC range. We will compare the results provided by DIALux with those obtained from Zemax OpticStudio in three different scenarios. We compared the minimum, maximum, and mean irradiance at the detection plane. The differences between the two software were less than 12%, 2%, and 6%, respectively. We also compared the contour maps of isoirradiance lines. We conclude that DIALux is well suited for UVC lighting design in the UVC range. We think that this finding will contribute to increasing the design and manufacturing of new UVC disinfection systems needed to fight against the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic."
189,10122020126451,"INTRODUCTION: As soon as the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic, many higher education facilities had to change their educational and teaching strategies to cope with the lockdown. Some medical schools decided to rely on online teaching while others depended on students' self-learning abilities. Methods of assessment also changed as some medical schools implemented pass/fail exams, online examinations, and research projects while others postponed their final exams. In Egypt, medical schools started delivering their lectures online and changed the assessment criteria of the preclinical academic years to depend mainly on research and online exams while postponed the clinical rotations and final exams of the clinical years. AIM: This study assesses medical students' awareness of the current situation regarding the safety guidelines and their satisfaction with the solutions provided by their schools for the plans to continue their learning and the new assessment methods and criteria. METHODOLOGY: The method used for data collection is an online survey filled by medical students from around Egypt. Moreover, data were statistically analyzed using IBM statistical package SPSS for doing a Chi-squared test on two variables. RESULTS: After collecting the data and analyzing responses, we found that 66.2% of students who answered the survey do not think that the safety measures taken by their universities after the return back will be enough. CONCLUSION: This shows that the basic knowledge of COVID-19 among medical students is average and there is a need to start programs for infection control practices against COVID-19 for all medical students and professionals."
190,101620210412899,"The high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 makes it essential to develop a rapid and accurate diagnostic test so that carriers can be isolated at an early stage. Viral RNA in nasopharyngeal samples by RT-PCR is currently considered the reference method although it is not recognized as a strong gold standard due to certain drawbacks. Here we develop a methodology combining the analysis of from human nasopharyngeal (NP) samples by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) with the use of machine learning (ML). A total of 236 NP samples collected in two different viral transport media were analyzed with minimal sample preparation and the subsequent mass spectra data was used to build different ML models with two different techniques. The best model showed high performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, in all cases reaching values higher than 90%. Our results suggest that the analysis of NP samples by MALDI-TOF MS and ML is a simple, safe, fast and economic diagnostic test for COVID-19."
191,10162021042823,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic has brought attention to the importance of correctly using personal protective equipment (PPE). Doffing is a critical phase that increases the risk of contamination of health care workers. Although a gamified electronic learning (e-learning) module has been shown to increase the adequate choice of PPE among prehospital personnel, it failed to enhance knowledge regarding donning and doffing sequences. Adding other training modalities such as face-to-face training to these e-learning tools is therefore necessary to increase prehospital staff proficiency and thus help reduce the risk of contamination. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study is to assess the impact of the Peyton 4-step approach in addition to a gamified e-learning module for teaching the PPE doffing sequence to first-year paramedic students. METHODS Participants will first follow a gamified e-learning module before being randomized into one of two groups. In the control group, participants will be asked to perform a PPE doffing sequence, which will be video-recorded to allow for subsequent assessment. In the experimental group, participants will first undergo face-to-face training performed by third-year students using the Peyton 4-step approach before performing the doffing sequence themselves, which will also be video-recorded. All participants will then be asked to reconstruct the doffing sequence on an online platform. The recorded sequences will be assessed independently by two investigators: a prehospital emergency medicine expert and an infection prevention and control specialist. The assessors will be blinded to group allocation. Four to eight weeks after this first intervention, all participants will be asked to record the doffing sequence once again for a subsequent skill retention assessment and to reconstruct the sequence on the same online platform to assess knowledge retention. Finally, participants belonging to the control group will follow face-to-face training. RESULTS The study protocol has been presented to the regional ethics committee (Req-2020-01340), which issued a declaration of no objection as such projects do not fall within the scope of the Swiss federal law on human research. Study sessions were performed in January and February 2021 in Geneva, and will be performed in April and June 2021 in Bern. CONCLUSIONS This study should help to determine whether face-to-face training using the Peyton 4-step approach improves the application and knowledge retention of a complex procedure when combined with an e-learning module.

Icosapent ethyl is currently undergoing clinical trials to determine its anti-inflammatory effects in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This report describes 3 intensive care unit (ICU) patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia treated with icosapent ethyl as part of their supportive care who had favorable outcomes. CASE REPORTS: Case 1 was a 75-year-old man with a past medical history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Case 2 was a 23-year old man with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. Case 3 was a 24-year old man with a history of autism. All cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection were confirmed from a nasopharyngeal swab using the Becton Dickinson nasopharyngeal reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. All patients in these cases were treated with a course of 2 g of icosapent ethyl twice a day by nasogastric tube. CONCLUSIONS: This report of 3 cases describes the use of icosapent ethyl as a component of supportive treatments in ICU patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. However, as of yet there are no evidence-based treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection from controlled clinical trials. The outcomes of ongoing clinical trials are awaited to determine whether icosapent ethyl has anti-inflammatory effects in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and which patients might benefit from the use of this adjunctive treatment."

As of now, there are no vaccines or antiviral drugs declared to be officially useful against the infection. Saikosaponin is a group of oleanane derivatives reported in Chinese medicinal plants and are described for their anti-viral, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsant, antinephritis and hepatoprotective activities. They have also been known to have anti-coronaviral property by interfering the early stage of viral replication including absorption and penetration of the virus. Thus, the present study was undertaken to screen and evaluate the potency of different Saikosaponins against different sets of SARS-CoV-2 binding protein via computational molecular docking simulations. Docking was carried out on a Glide module of Schrodinger Maestro 2018-1 MM Share Version on NSP15 (PDB ID: 6W01) and Prefusion 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein (PDB ID: 6VSB) from SARS-CoV-2. From the binding energy and interaction studies, the Saikosaponins U and V showed the best affinity towards both the proteins suggesting them to be future research molecule as they mark the desire interaction with NSP15, which is responsible for replication of RNA and also with 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein which manage the connection with ACE2.

196,101020201012521,"INTRODUCTION: The global health emergency caused by the current COVID-19 pandemic is resulting in a huge challenge at all levels. The use of masks may reduce the spread of the infection by minimising the excretion of Flügge droplets. The objective of this study was to compile the evidence available on the use of masks in relation to respiratory infections. METHODOLOGY: An umbrella review (review of systematic reviews) was conducted. Two reviewers independently carried out the screening process, data extraction and data analysis. Discrepancies were resolved with a third reviewer, and the assessment of the risk of bias of the studies was carried out using the AMSTAR 2 tool. The Rayyan QCRI program was used for the screening process. RESULTS: A total of eight systematic reviews were included. The studies analysed the use of masks in the general population, in long-term care facilities, in hospitals and at mass gatherings, and compared the effectiveness thereof in preventing infection. The results of this review revealed that the use of masks is associated with a protective effect against respiratory infections in healthcare facilities, in long-term care facilities and at mass gatherings. CONCLUSIONS: In light of the results, it seems reasonable to recommend the use of masks to the general population, but this use should be accompanied by a training programme to improve compliance, as not using them properly may increase the risk of infection."
197,100820200812416,"Background: Reinfection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is debated. We assessed risk and incidence rate of documented SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in a large cohort of laboratory-confirmed cases in Qatar. Methods: All SARS-CoV-2 laboratory-confirmed cases with at least one PCR positive swab that is [â¥]45 days after a first-positive swab were individually investigated for evidence of reinfection, and classified as showing strong, good, some, or weak/no evidence for reinfection. Viral genome sequencing of the paired first-positive and reinfection viral specimens was conducted to confirm reinfection. Risk and incidence rate of reinfection were estimated. Results: Out of 133,266 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, 243 persons (0.18%) had at least one subsequent positive swab [â¥]45 days after the first-positive swab. Of these, 54 cases (22.2%) had strong or good evidence for reinfection. Median time between first and reinfection swab was 64.5 days (range: 45-129). Twenty-three of the 54 cases (42.6%) were diagnosed at a health facility suggesting presence of symptoms, while 31 (57.4%) were identified incidentally through random testing campaigns/surveys or contact tracing. Only one person was hospitalized at time of reinfection, but still with mild infection. No deaths were recorded. Viral genome sequencing confirmed four out of 12 cases with available genetic evidence. Risk of reinfection was estimated at 0.01% (95% CI: 0.01-0.02%) and incidence rate of reinfection was estimated at 0.36 (95% CI: 0.28-0.47) per 10,000 person-weeks. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 reinfection can occur but is a rare phenomenon suggestive of a strong protective immunity against reinfection that lasts for at least a few months post primary infection."
198,10082020088865,"The year 2020 is facing one of the worst public health situations in decades. The world is experiencing a pandemic that has triggered significant challenges to healthcare systems in both high and low‐middle income countries (LMICs). Government policymakers and healthcare personnel are experiencing real‐life ethical dilemmas and are pressed to respond to these situations. Many possible treatments are being investigated, one of which is the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine. These drugs are approved for use by patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and malaria. The demand for these products has increased, and the stocks are depleting for the patient population for whom the drugs are intended initially. Although both innovator and generic pharmaceutical manufacturers are making plans for increased production, there are challenges with global supply chains disruption and the retention of supplies for local markets. This may cause countries that rely on the importation of pharmaceuticals to be out of stock of supplies for an extended period. There are allegations of off‐label prescribing and hoarding. Pharmacists are the custodians and dispensers of medications and are faced with the task of assessing prescriptions and making decisions about the allocation of these products. This paper seeks to 1) highlight some of the ethical challenges of dispensing hydroxychloroquine by pharmacists during the COVID‐19 pandemic, 2) identify some of the responses to these issues from various regulatory authorities in the USA, and 3) recommend approaches to assist pharmacists in their decision‐making process, especially in LMICs."
199,10172021050232,"BACKGROUND: There is a growing number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating interventions to prevent or treat delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU). Efforts to improve the conduct of delirium RCTs are underway, but none address issues related to statistical analysis. The purpose of this review is to evaluate heterogeneity in the design and analysis of delirium outcomes and advance methodological recommendations for delirium RCTs in the ICU. METHODS: Relevant databases, including PubMed and Embase, were searched with no restrictions on language or publication date; the search was conducted on July 8, 2019. RCTs conducted on adult ICU patients with delirium as the primary outcome were included where trial results were available. Data on frequency and duration of delirium assessments, delirium outcome definitions, and statistical methods were independently extracted in duplicate. The review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020141204). RESULTS: Among 65 eligible RCTs, 44 (68%) targeted the prevention of delirium. The duration of follow-up varied, with 31 (48%) RCTs having 7 days of follow-up, and only 24 (37%) conducting delirium assessments after ICU discharge. The incidence of delirium was the most common outcome (50 RCTs, 77%) for which 8 unique statistical methods were applied. The most common method, applied to 51 of 56 (91%) delirium incidence outcomes, was the two-sample test comparing the proportion of patients who ever experienced delirium. In the presence of censoring of patients at ICU discharge or death, this test may be misleading. The impact of censoring was also not considered in most analyses of the duration of delirium, as evaluated in 24 RCTs, with 21 (88%) delirium duration outcomes analyzed using a non-parametric test or two-sample t test. Composite outcomes (e.g., rank-based delirium- and coma-free days), used in 11 (17%) RCTs, seldom explicitly defined how ICU discharge, and death were incorporated into the definition and were analyzed using non-parametric tests (11 of 13 (85%) composite outcomes). CONCLUSIONS: To improve delirium RCTs, outcomes should be explicitly defined. To account for censoring due to ICU discharge or death, survival analysis methods should be considered for delirium incidence and duration outcomes; non-parametric tests are recommended for rank-based delirium composite outcomes.

200,10132021019237,"BACKGROUND: Nearly 40% of parents with children aged 6 to 17 months consult a healthcare professional when their child has a high temperature. Clinical guidelines recommend temperature measurement in these children, but little is known about parents’ experiences of and beliefs about temperature measurement. This study aimed to explore parents’ concerns and beliefs about temperature measurement in children. METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted from May 2017 to June 2018 with 21 parents of children aged 4 months to 5.5 years, who were purposively sampled from the METRIC study (a method comparison study comparing non-contact infrared thermometers to axillary and tympanic thermometers in acutely ill children). Data analysis followed a thematic approach. RESULTS: Parents described the importance of being able to detect fever, in particular high fevers, and how this then influenced their actions. The concept of “accuracy” was valued by parents but the aspects of performance which were felt to reflect accuracy varied. Parents used numerical values of temperature in four main ways: determining precision of the thermometer on repeat measures, detecting a “bad” fever, as an indication to administer antipyretics, or monitoring response to treatment. Family and social networks, the internet, and medical professionals and resources, were all key sources of advice for parents regarding fever, and guiding thermometer choice. CONCLUSIONS: Temperature measurement in children has diagnostic value but can either empower, or cause anxiety and practical challenges for parents. This represents an opportunity for both improved communication between parents and healthcare professionals, and technological development, to support parents to manage febrile illness with greater confidence in the home.

202,100920200913320,"COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to being a global health emergency, has multiple socioeconomic and psychological ramifications. COVID-19 research and media reports have revealed a rise in fears related to contracting the virus. Though fear is a common psychological outcome during pandemics, the COVID-19 pandemic is a continuously evolving disease outbreak and has unique risk factors. Therefore, fear related to COVID-19 might manifest in not only fear and anxiety related to disease contraction and dying but also associated socio-occupational stress. We attempt to understand the psychosocial process of the development of coronaphobia and postulate what constitutes coronaphobia, a new emerging phobia specific to COVID-19. We present a conceptual model delineating the risk factors causing coronaphobia and the underlying mechanisms, for a better understanding of its developmental process. From review of relevant research, the factors identified are, an unforeseen reality, unending uncertainties, need of acquiring new practices and avoidance behavior, loss of faith in health infrastructure, contraction of COVID-19 by head of states, cautionary statements from international bodies, and infodemia. These factors are assumed to cause interference with routine life, catastrophizing interpretation of benign symptoms, and social amplification of risk which lead to coronaphobia. The conceptualization of coronaphobia and the model will aid future research in developing psychometric measure of coronaphobia for use in clinical and research settings and design of policies and interventions for mitigating risk factors."

Whilst measures to abate transmission and infection are ongoing, there continues to be growing numbers of patients requiring chronic support, which is already putting a strain on health care systems around the world and which may do so for years to come. A legacy of COVID-19 will be a long-term requirement to support patients with dedicated rehabilitation and support services. With many clinical settings characterized by a lack of funding and resources, the need to provide these additional services could overwhelm clinical capacity. This position statement from the Healthy Living for Pandemic Event Protection (HL-PIVOT) Network provides a collaborative blueprint focused on leading research and developing clinical guidelines, bringing together professionals with expertise in clinical services and the exercise sciences to develop the evidence base needed to improve outcomes for patients infected by COVID-19."
205,10122020120034,"Cleaning the floor, stripping the bed, arranging a bouquet of flowers—such tasks are essential to keeping a hospital room clean and creating a pleasant atmosphere. They usually fall under the purview of female* nurses, cleaning staff and housekeepers. In everyday hospital life, the demands for hygienic cleanliness commingle with the imperatives of economization, marketing logic, and attention to the affective and emotional needs of the actors in these rooms. Although the standards of clinical hygiene are based on medical knowledge, the division of labor and the demands for cleanliness at various hierarchical levels also reveal gendered and partly racialized ideas that point beyond the clinical context. This blending of imperatives in the hospital environment invites deeper consideration of the history of bacteriology: The logic and language of defense against infection in science and everyday life is also interwoven with social markers of difference. Drawing on the findings of an ethnography on cleanliness and cleaning work in hospitals, as well as a history of knowledge approach, the article links the question of (feminized) care for the environment with the question of the atmosphere of clinical rooms. In what ways, and to what effect, does scientific knowledge about medical hygiene also carry with it cultural and aesthetic perceptions of beautiful and pleasant cleanliness that reveal feminine connotations rooted in the nineteenth century?"
206,101220201210263,"Background: Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) when used isolated or combined with static magnetic field (PBMT-sMF) has been proven benefits on skeletal muscle increasing performance and reducing fatigue, increasing oxygen saturation, and modulating inflammatory process. However, it is unknown whether the effects observed with this therapy on respiratory muscles will be similar to the effects previously observed on skeletal muscles. Objective: We aimed to investigate whether PBMT-sMF is able to decrease the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and to reduce the mortality rate of patients with severe COVID-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, increasing the respiratory function and modulating the inflammatory process. Methods: We conducted a prospectively registered, pragmatic, triple-blinded (patients, therapists and outcome assessors), randomized, placebo-controlled trial of PBMT-sMF in patients with severe COVID-19, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, admitted to the ICU. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either PBMT-sMF (6 sites at the lower thorax - 189 J total, and 2 sites at the neck area - 63 J total) or placebo PBMT-sMF daily during all the ICU stay. The primary outcome was length of stay in the ICU defined by either discharge or death. The secondary outcomes were survival rate, muscle function of diaphragm, change in blood tests, change in mechanical ventilation parameters and change in arterial blood gas analysis. Results: A total of 30 patients underwent randomization (with 15 assigned to PBMT-sMF and 15 to placebo) and were analyzed. The length of stay in the ICU for the placebo group was 23.06 days while for the PBMT-sMF group was 16.26. However, there was no statistically difference between groups for the length of stay in the ICU (mean difference - MD = - 6.80; 95 {per thousand}CI = - 18.71 to 5.11). Regarding the secondary outcomes were observed statistically differences in favor of PBMT-sMF for diaphragm thickness, fraction of inspired oxygen, partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio, C-reactive protein, lymphocytes count, and hemoglobin (p<0.05). Conclusion: Among patients with severe COVID-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, PBMT-sMF was not superior to placebo in decrease the length of stay in the ICU. In contrast, PBMT-sMF increased muscle function of diaphragm, improved ventilatory parameters, decreased C-reactive protein levels and hemoglobin count, and increased lymphocytes count.

207,10062020067434,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease‐2019 (COVID‐19) has been associated with cardiovascular complications and coagulation disorders. OBJECTIVES: To explore the coagulopathy and endothelial dysfunction in COVID‐19 patients. METHODS: Study analyzed clinical and biological profiles of patients with suspected COVID‐19 infection at admission, including hemostasis tests and quantification of circulating endothelial cells (CECs). RESULTS: Among 96 consecutive COVID‐19‐suspected patients fulfilling criteria for hospitalization, 66 were tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2. COVID‐19 positive patients were more likely to present with fever (p=0.02), cough (p=0.03) and pneumonia at CT‐scan (p=0.002) at admission. Prevalence of D‐dimer >500 ng/mL was higher in COVID‐19 positive patients (74.2% vs. 43.3%; p=0.007). No sign of disseminated intravascular coagulation were identified. Adding D‐dimers >500 ng/mL to gender and pneumonia at CT scan in ROC curve analysis significantly increased AUC for COVID‐19 diagnosis. COVID‐19 positive patients had significantly more CECs at admission (p=0.008) than COVID‐19 negative ones. COVID‐19 positive patients treated with curative anticoagulant prior to admission had less CECs (p=0.02) than those without. Interestingly, patients treated with curative anticoagulation and ACEi or ARBs had even lesser CECs (p=0.007). CONCLUSION: Curative anticoagulation could prevent COVID‐19‐associated coagulopathy and endothelial lesion."
208,10052020051424,"Matrix factorization is a very common machine learning technique in recommender systems. Bayesian Matrix Factorization (BMF) algorithms would be attractive because of their ability to quantify uncertainty in their predictions and avoid over-fitting, combined with high prediction accuracy. However, they have not been widely used on large-scale data because of their prohibitive computational cost. In recent work, efforts have been made to reduce the cost, both by improving the scalability of the BMF algorithm as well as its implementation, but so far mainly separately. In this paper we show that the state-of-the-art of both approaches to scalability can be combined. We combine the recent highly-scalable Posterior Propagation algorithm for BMF, which parallelizes computation of blocks of the matrix, with a distributed BMF implementation that users asynchronous communication within each block. We show that the combination of the two methods gives substantial improvements in the scalability of BMF on web-scale datasets, when the goal is to reduce the wall-clock time."
209,10112020116024,"BACKGROUND: Polyneuropathies are infrequently described in cats. There is a genetic predisposition in several breeds. OBJECTIVE: To clinically characterize a novel motor polyneuropathy in a family of Siberian cats. ANIMALS: Thirteen closely related Siberian cats, 4 clinically affected and 9 clinically unaffected individuals. METHODS: Retrospective study. Clinical data and pedigree information were obtained from the medical records and breeder. Electrodiagnostic testing and muscle and peripheral nerve biopsy samples were obtained from 1 affected cat. Follow‐up information was obtained for all affected cats. RESULTS: Onset of signs was 4 to 10 months in affected cats. Clinical signs were progressive or waxing/waning neuromuscular weakness (4/4), normal sensory function (4/4), and variably decreased withdrawal reflexes (3/4). All cats returned to normal neurologic function within 1 to 4 weeks. All cats had a recurrence of weakness (3/4 had 1 recurrent episode, 1/4 had 3 relapses) from which they recovered fully. In 1 cat, electromyography and motor nerve conduction studies showed multicentric spontaneous activity, normal motor nerve conduction velocity, reduced compound muscle action potential amplitude, and polyphasia. Histologic evaluation of muscle and nerve in that cat showed mild muscle atrophy consistent with recent denervation, endoneurial and perineurial edema, and mild mononuclear cell infiltration within intramuscular nerve branches and a peripheral nerve. Pedigree analysis suggests an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, although neither a genetically complex/polygenic condition nor an acquired inflammatory polyneuropathy can be ruled‐out. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: We describe a motor polyneuropathy in juvenile Siberian cats characterized by self‐limiting weakness with potential relapse."
210,10042020044796,"Individuals with diabetes are at increased risk for bacterial, mycotic, parasitic and viral infections. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV2 (also referred to as COVID-19) coronavirus pandemic highlights the importance of understanding shared disease pathophysiology potentially informing therapeutic choices in individuals with Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Two coronavirus receptor proteins, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP4) are also established transducers of metabolic signals and pathways regulating inflammation, renal and cardiovascular physiology, and glucose homeostasis. Moreover, glucose-lowering agents such as the DPP4 inhibitors, widely used in subjects with T2D, are known to modify the biological activities of multiple immunomodulatory substrates. Here we review the basic and clinical science spanning the intersections of diabetes, coronavirus infections, ACE2, and DPP4 biology, highlighting clinical relevance and evolving areas of uncertainty underlying the pathophysiology and treatment of T2D in the context of coronavirus infection"
211,10102020103396,"OBJECTIVE We deployed a Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) program to monitor patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) upon hospital discharge. We describe the patient characteristics, program characteristics, and clinical outcomes of patients in our RPM program. METHODS We enrolled COVID-19 patients being discharged home from the hospital. Enrolled patients had an app, and were provided with a pulse oximeter and thermometer. Patients self-reported symptoms, O2 saturation, and temperature daily. Abnormal symptoms or vital signs were flagged and assessed by a pool of nurses. Descriptive statistics were used to describe patient and program characteristics. A mixed-effects logistic regression model was used to determine the odds of a combined endpoint of emergency department (ED) or hospital readmission. RESULTS A total of 295 patients were referred for RPM from five participating hospitals, and 225 patients were enrolled. A majority of enrolled patients (66%) completed the monitoring period without triggering an abnormal alert. Enrollment was associated with a decreased odds of ED or hospital readmission (adjusted odds ratio: 0.54; 95% confidence interval: 0.3-0.97; p = 0.039). Referral without enrollment was not associated with a reduced odds of ED or hospital readmission. CONCLUSION RPM for COVID-19 provides a mechanism to monitor patients in their home environment and reduce hospital utilization. Our work suggests that RPM reduces readmissions for patients with COVID-19 and provides scalable remote monitoring capabilities upon hospital discharge. RPM for postdischarge patients with COVID-19 was associated with a decreased risk of readmission to the ED or hospital, and provided a scalable mechanism to monitor patients in their home environment."
212,10072020072786,"AIMS Arterial stiffness is an underlying risk factor and a hallmark of cardiovascular diseases. The endothelial cell (EC) glycocalyx is a glycan rich surface layer that plays a key role in protecting against EC dysfunction and vascular disease. However, the mechanisms by which arterial stiffness promotes endothelial cell dysfunction and vascular disease are not fully understood, and whether the mechanism involves the protective endothelial glycocalyx is yet to be determined. We hypothesized that endothelial glycocalyx protects the endothelial cells lining the vascular wall from dysfunction and disease in response to arterial stiffness. METHODS AND RESULTS Cells cultured on polyacrylamide (PA) gels of substrate stiffness 10 kPa (mimicking the subendothelial stiffness of aged, unhealthy arteries) showed a significant inhibition of glycocalyx expression compared to cells cultured on softer PA gels (2.5 kPa, mimicking the subendothelial stiffness of young, healthy arteries). Specifically, gene and protein analyses revealed that a glycocalyx core protein Glypican 1 was inhibited in cells cultured on stiff PA gels. These cells had enhanced endothelial cell dysfunction as determined by enhanced cell inflammation (enhanced inflammatory gene expression, monocyte adhesion and inhibited nitric oxide expression), proliferation and EndMT. Removal of Glypican 1 using gene-specific silencing with siRNA or gene overexpression using a plasmid revealed that Glypican 1 is required to protect against stiffness-mediated endothelial cell dysfunction. Consistent with this, using a model of age-mediated stiffness, older mice exhibited a reduced expression of Glypican 1 and enhanced endothelial cell dysfunction compared to young mice. Glypican1 gene deletion in knockout mice (GPC1 -/-) exacerbated endothelial dysfunction in young mice, which normally had high endothelial expression, but not in old mice that normally expressed low levels.Endothelial cell dysfunction was exacerbated in young, but not aged, Glypican 1 knockout mice (GPC1 -/-). CONCLUSIONS Arterial stiffness promotes EC dysfunction and vascular disease at least partly through the suppression of the glycocalyx protein Glypican 1. Glypican 1 contributes to the protection against endothelial cell dysfunction and vascular disease in endothelial cells. TRANSLATIONAL PERSPECTIVE This work reveals for the first time the effect of arterial stiffness on the glycocalyx protein Glypican 1 in endothelial cell function. Stiffness promotes endothelial cell dysfunction and subsequently vascular disease at least partly through the suppression of Glypican 1. Thus, Glypican 1 could be a novel therapeutic candidate for the treatment/reversal of arterial stiffness-mediated vascular disease."
213,10112020119317,"Intrinsic value is related to intrinsic motivation and influences learners’ decisions to begin, continue, and return to learning tasks. In the context of a fully online foreign language English course, we used structural equation modeling to explore the motivation for asynchronous collaborative writing practice, motivation for video-synchronous speaking practice, course satisfaction, and the mediating effect course satisfaction has on behavioral intentions to use language learning technology. Cross-sectional survey results (n = 186) revealed that students who were motivated by asynchronous online collaborative writing were more likely to enjoy online learning in general when compared to students who reported motivation for video-synchronous online speaking practice. Moreover, the relationship between motivation for collaborative writing and behavioral intentions to use language learning technology was mediated by course satisfaction. A follow-up open-ended survey (n = 65) revealed that students held positive views for online second language writing and speaking practice overall but for distinctly different reasons. The findings are discussed in terms of their theoretical implications for modeling e-learning approaches with significance for promoting instructional training effectiveness and transformative learning."
214,100720200711909,"D614G spike glycoprotein (sgp) mutation in rapidly spreading severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐COV‐2) is associated with enhanced fitness and higher transmissibility in new cases of COVID‐19 but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, using atomistic simulation, a plausible mechanism has been delineated. In G614 sgp but not wild type, increased D(G)614‐T859 Cα‐distance within 65 ns is interpreted as S1/S2 protomer dissociation. Overall, ACE2‐binding, post‐fusion core, open‐state and sub‐optimal antibody‐binding conformations were preferentially sampled by the G614 mutant, but not wild type. Furthermore, in the wild type, only one of the three sgp chains has optimal communication route between residue 614 and the receptor‐binding domain (RBD); whereas, two of the three chains communicated directly in G614 mutant. These data provide evidence that D614G sgp mutant is more available for receptor binding, cellular invasion and reduced antibody interaction; thus, providing framework for enhanced fitness and higher transmissibility in D614G SARS‐COV‐2 mutant."
215,10062020068707,"Coronavirus infection outbreaks have occurred frequently in the last two decades and have led to significant mortality. Despite the focus on reducing mortality by preventing the spread of the virus, patients have died due to several other complications of the illness. The understanding of pathological mechanisms and their implications is continuously evolving. A number of symptoms occur in these patients due to the involvement of various endocrine glands. These clinical presentations went largely unnoticed during the first outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002–2003. A few of these derangements continued during the convalescence phase and sometimes occurred after recovery. Similar pathological and biochemical changes are being reported with the novel coronavirus disease outbreak in 2020. In this review, we focus on these endocrine changes that have been reported in both SARS coronavirus and SARS coronavirus-2. As we battle the pandemic, it becomes imperative to address these underlying endocrine disturbances that are contributing towards or predicting mortality of these patients."
216,10092020093522,"Elite athletes suffer many mental health symptoms and disorders at rates equivalent to or exceeding those of the general population. COVID-19 has created new strains on elite athletes, thus potentially increasing their vulnerability to mental health symptoms. This manuscript serves as a narrative review of the impact of the pandemic on management of those symptoms in elite athletes and ensuing recommendations to guide that management. It specifically addresses psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy and higher levels of care. Within the realm of psychotherapy, crisis counselling might be indicated. Individual, couple/family and group psychotherapy modalities all may be helpful during the pandemic, with novel content and means of delivery. Regarding pharmacotherapy for mental health symptoms and disorders, some important aspects of management have changed during the pandemic, particularly for certain classes of medication including stimulants, medications for bipolar and psychotic disorders, antidepressants and medications for substance use disorders. Providers must consider when in-person management (eg, for physical examination, laboratory testing) or higher levels of care (eg, for crisis stabilisation) is necessary, despite potential risk of viral exposure during the pandemic. Management ultimately should continue to follow general principles of quality health care with some flexibility. Finally, the current pandemic provides an important opportunity for research on new methods of providing mental health care for athletes, and consideration for whether these new methods should extend beyond the pandemic."
217,101620210412655,"This paper demonstrates that transportation networks may be used to assess and predict the regional risk of COVID-19 infection from the outbreak. We use China’s high-speed rail (HSR) network at the scale of prefecture level to assess, based on a probabilistic risk model, the risk of COVID-19 infection from Wuhan to the country’s 31 province-level regions at the early stage of domestic spread. We find that the high-risk regions are mainly distributed along the southern half of Beijing-Hong Kong HSR line, where a large number of infection cases have been confirmed at the early stage. Furthermore, the two components of the infection risk, namely, the probability (proxied by the region’s correlation with Wuhan through HSR) and the impact (proxied by the region’s population with mobility), can play different roles in the risk ranking for different regions. For public health administrators, these findings may be used for better decision making, including the preparation of emergency plans and supplies, and the allocation of limited resources, before the extensive spread of the epidemic. Moreover, the administrators should adopt different intervention measures for different regions, so as to better mitigate the epidemic spread according to their own risk scenarios with respect to the probability of occurring and, once occurred, the impact."
218,10172021056643,"SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA (+) virus first identified in China and then became an ongoing global outbreak. In most cases, it is fatal in humans due to respiratory malfunction. Extensive researches are going to find an effective therapeutic technique for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. In this study, we attempted to design a siRNA molecule to silence the most suitable nucleocapsid(N) gene of SARS-CoV-2, which play a major role during viral pathogenesis, replication, encapsidation and RNA packaging. At first, 270 complete N gene sequences of different strains in Bangladesh of these viruses were retrieved from the NCBI database. Different computational methods were used to design siRNA molecules. A siRNA molecule was built against these strains using the SiDirect 2.0 server. Using Mfold and the OligoCalc server, the siRNA molecule was tested for its secondary structure and GC material. The Clustal Omega tool was employed to evaluate any off-target harmony of the planned siRNA molecule. Herein, we proposed a duplex siRNA molecule that does not fit any off-target sequences for the gene silencing of SARS-CoV-2. To treat SARS-CoV-2 infections, currently, any effective therapy is not available. Our engineered siRNA molecule could give an alternative therapeutic approach against various sequenced SARS-CoV-2 strains in Bangladesh."
219,10142021026606,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: This study aims to analyze the clinical outcome of a new ultrasound-guided surgery for partial plantar fasciotomy performed with a needle for treatment of plantar fasciitis. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 107 patients diagnosed with plantar fasciitis who underwent ultrasound-guided release of the plantar fascia. The series included 62 males (57.9%) and 45 females (42.1%) treated between April 2014 and February 2018, with a mean follow-up of 21.05 ± 10.96 months (7–66) and a minimum follow-up of 24 months. The mean age was 48.10 ± 10.27 years (27–72). Clinical assessments and ultrasound examination were carried out before treatment, after 1 week, and then after 1, 3, 12, and 24 months. The clinical assessment was based on a visual analog scale and the Foot and Ankle Disability Index. RESULTS: Heel pain improved in 92.5% (99) of patients, but not in 7.4% (8 patients). In the group of patients whose heel pain improved, 9 experienced overload on the lateral column and dorsum of the foot, which improved with the use of plantar orthoses and a rehabilitation program. We recorded no nerve complications (e.g., paresthesia), vascular injuries, or wound-related problems. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-guided partial plantar fasciotomy with a needle is safe, since structures are under direct visualization of the surgeon and the risk of damage is minimal. Stitches are not necessary, and recovery is fast. Consequently, costs are low, and the patient can return to work quickly. This technique may represent a valid option for treatment of plantar fasciitis."
220,10142021029535,"Enveloped viruses hijack not only the host translation processes, but also its glycosylation machinery, and to a variable extent cover viral surface proteins with tolerogenic host-like structures. SARS-CoV-2 surface protein S presents as a trimer on the viral surface and is covered by a dense shield of N-linked glycans, and a few O-glycosites have been reported. The location of O-glycans is controlled by a large family of initiating enzymes with variable expression in cells and tissues and hence difficult to predict. Here, we used our well-established O-glycoproteomic workflows to map the precise positions of O-linked glycosylation sites on three different entities of protein S – insect cell or human cell-produced ectodomains, or insect cell derived receptor binding domain (RBD). In total 25 O-glycosites were identified, with similar patterns in the two ectodomains of different cell origin, and a distinct pattern of the monomeric RBD. Strikingly, 16 out of 25 O-glycosites were located within three amino acids from known N-glycosites. However, O-glycosylation was primarily found on peptides that were unoccupied by N-glycans, and otherwise had low overall occupancy. This suggests possible complimentary functions of O-glycans in immune shielding and negligible effects of O-glycosylation on subunit vaccine design for SARS-CoV-2."

222,10122020127983,"OBJECTIVE: Assess the quality of a new disposable nasopharyngolaryngoscope (NPL) through resident feedback at multiple academic institutions and provide a cost analysis of reusable and disposable NPLs at a single academic center. STUDY DESIGN: An online survey was distributed to residents at institutions throughout the United States that have implemented use of a disposable NPL (Ambu aScope 4 Rhinolaryngo). SETTING: Cost analysis performed at a single academic center. Resident survey distributed to multiple residency programs throughout the United States. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The survey collected demographic information and asked residents to rate the new disposable NPL and other reusable NPLs using a 5‐point Likert scale. A cost analysis was performed of both reusable and disposable NPLs using information obtained at a single academic center. RESULTS: The survey was distributed to 109 residents throughout the country and 37 were completed for a response rate of 33.9%. The disposable NPL was comparable to reusable NPLs based on ergonomics and maneuverability, inferior in imaging quality (P < .001), and superior in setup (P < .001), convenience (P < .001), and rated better overall (P < .04). The disposable NPL was found to be cheaper per use than reusable NPLs at $171.82 and $170.36 compared to $238.17 and $197.88 per use for the reusable NPL if the life span is 1 year and 5 years respectively. CONCLUSION: Disposable NPLs may offer an alternative option and initial feedback obtained from resident physicians is favorable. Cost analysis favors disposable NPLs as the cost‐effective option.

223,10112020111993,"Protein phosphorylation is the most significant post-translational modification for regulating cellular activities, but site-specific modulation of phosphorylation is still challenging. Using three-dimensional NMR spectra, molecular dynamics simulations, and alanine mutations, we identified that the interaction network between pT69/pS70 and R106/R109 residues prevents the phosphorylation sites from exposure to phosphatase and subsequent dephosphorylation. A Bcl-2-dephosphorylation probe, S1-6e, was designed by installing a carboxylic acid group to a Bcl-2 inhibitor. The carboxyl group competitively disrupts the interaction network between R106/R109 and pT69/pS70 and subsequently facilitates Bcl-2 dephosphorylation in living cells. As a result, S1-6e manifests a more effective apoptosis induction in pBcl-2-dependent cancer cells than other inhibitors exhibiting a similar binding affinity for Bcl-2. We believe that targeting the allosteric pathways interconnecting the core-functional domain and the phosphorylation site can be a general strategy for a rational design of site-specific dephosphorylating probes, since the allosteric pathway has been discovered in a variety of proteins."
224,10062020069419,"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to gain momentum around the world, several measures are being put in place to control its spread. One such effort includes the installation of walkthrough sanitization gates to disinfect passersby and prevent cross infection. However, there is lack of clinical evidence on the effectiveness of these walkthrough gates to contain COVID-19. Moreover, there are potential public health concerns associated with these walkthrough gates. Spraying individuals with disinfectant chemicals is strongly discouraged by various health authorities around the globe because of their propensity for eye and skin irritation, bronchospasm following inhalation, and gastrointestinal effects such as nausea and vomiting. This article underscores that the risks associated with the use of these walkthrough gates overweigh any potential benefits. Health authorities must discourage their use and should focus efforts on other preventive measures such as social distancing, wearing masks, and hand hygiene to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among the general public."
225,10172021059570,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has not been fully described. METHODS: All patients with STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in Ontario, Canada between March 1st and September 30th, 2020 were included. Rates of positive COVID-19 tests from January 1(st), 2020 to the date of STEMI were ascertained. For comparison, COVID-19 results were also evaluated in the adult Ontario population between January 1(st), 2020 to September 30(th), 2020 using provincial laboratory testing data. RESULTS: There were 3,606 unique patients presenting with STEMI and receiving PCI in Ontario, Canada during the study period. Sixteen patients (0.44%) tested positive for COVID-19. The background infection rate among all 12,448,541 Ontario residents was similar at 0.34%. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this population-based analysis suggest that proceeding with primary PCI with appropriate infection control practices is reasonable when community infection rates are low."
226,10112020118009,"PURPOSE: The optimal approach to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection among college students returning to campus is unknown. Recommendations vary from no testing to two tests per student. This research determined the strategy that optimizes the number of true positives and negatives detected and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests needed. METHODS: A decision tree analysis evaluated five strategies: (1) classifying students with symptoms as having COVID-19, (2) RT-PCR testing for symptomatic students, (3) RT-PCR testing for all students, (4) RT-PCR testing for all students and retesting symptomatic students with a negative first test, and (5) RT-PCR testing for all students and retesting all students with a negative first test. The number of true positives, true negatives, RT-PCR tests, and RT-PCR tests per true positive (TTP) was calculated. RESULTS: Strategy 5 detected the most true positives but also required the most tests. The percentage of correctly identified infections was 40.6%, 29.0%, 53.7%, 72.5%, and 86.9% for Strategies 1–5, respectively. All RT-PCR strategies detected more true negatives than the symptom-only strategy. Analysis of TTP demonstrated that the repeat RT-PCR strategies weakly dominated the single RT-PCR strategy and that the thresholds for more intensive RT-PCR testing decreased as the prevalence of infection increased. CONCLUSION: Based on TTP, the single RT-PCR strategy is never preferred. If the cost of RT-PCR testing is of concern, a staged approach involving initial testing of all returning students followed by a repeat testing decision based on the measured prevalence of infection might be considered."
227,10072020073498,"The remodeling of stalled replication forks to form four-way DNA junctions is an important component of the replication stress response. Nascent DNA at the regressed arms of these reversed forks is protected by RAD51 and the tumor suppressors BRCA1/2, and when this function is compromised, stalled forks undergo pathological MRE11-dependent degradation, leading to chromosomal instability. However, the mechanisms regulating MRE11 functions at reversed forks are currently unclear. Here, we identify the MRE11-binding protein MRNIP as a novel fork protection factor that directly binds to MRE11 and specifically represses its exonuclease activity. The loss of MRNIP results in impaired replication fork progression, MRE11 exonuclease-dependent degradation of reversed forks, persistence of underreplicated genomic regions, chemosensitivity, and chromosome instability. Our findings identify MRNIP as a novel regulator of MRE11 at reversed forks and provide evidence that regulation of specific MRE11 nuclease activities ensures protection of nascent DNA and thereby genome integrity."
228,10102020102088,"Storm events lead to agricultural and urban runoff, to mobilization of contaminated particulate matter and input from combined sewer overflows into rivers. We conducted time-resolved sampling during a storm event at the Ammer River, Southwest Germany, which is representative for small river systems in densely populated areas of temperate climate. From two sampling sites suspended particulate matter (SPM) and water were separately analyzed by a multi-analyte LC-MS-MS method for 97 environmentally relevant organic micropollutants and with two in-vitro bioassays. Oxidative stress response (AREc32) may become activated by various stressors covering a broad range of physico-chemical properties and aryl hydrocarbon receptor induction (AhR-CALUX) by hydrophobic compounds such as dioxins and dioxin-like molecules. Compound numbers, concentrations, their mass fluxes and associated effect fluxes increased substantially during the storm event. Micropollutants detected in water and on SPM pointed towards inputs from combined sewer overflow (e.g., caffeine, paracetamol), urban runoff (e.g., mecoprop, terbutryn) and agricultural areas (e.g., azoxystrobin, bentazone). Particle-facilitated transport of triphenylphosphate and tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate accounted for up to 34 and 33% of the total mass flux despite SPM concentrations below 1 g L-1 . Effect fluxes attributed to SPM were similar or higher than in the water phase. The important role of SPM-bound transport emphasizes the need to consider not only concentrations but also mass and effect fluxes for surface water quality assessment and wastewater/stormwater treatment options.

229,10042020045488,"BACKGROUND We described the epidemiological features of the codiv-19 outbreak, and evaluated the impact of interventions measures on the epidemic in the Lombardy region, Italy. METHODS Laboratory-confirmed covid-19 cases reported through the beginning of April were extracted from the Italian Civil Protection database. Based on key events and interventions, we divided the epidemic into three periods: before February 21, from February 22 to early March, after early March. We compared epidemiological characteristics across periods and developed a modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to study the epidemic and evaluate the impact of interventions. We explicitly took into account for unascertained cases (positive cases with no symptoms or mild symptoms that have not been accounted for in official statistics). RESULTS Currently, the number of positive active cases has increased to around 30,000 in the Lombardy region. Due to restriction measures, the effective reproduction number dropped from 3.33 (95% CI: 2.03-3.69) during the first period, to 2.36 (95% CI: 2.21-2.70) during the second period. In the third period, the effective reproduction number is estimated to have dropped to 1.49 (95% CI: 1.35-1.62). The model estimates a great proportion of unascertained cases, about 90% of infected people has not been accounted for in official statistics. CONCLUSIONS Considerable countermeasures have slowed down the covid-19 outbreak in the Lombardy region. However, notwithstanding the long-lasting lockdown period, the epidemic is still not under control. The effective reproduction number, according to the model used in this work, is still greater than 1.0. Estimation of unascertained cases has important implications on continuing surveillance and interventions."
230,10082020086848,"Mobile health apps (MHAs) and medical apps (MAs) are becoming increasingly popular as digital interventions in a wide range of health-related applications in almost all sectors of healthcare. The surge in demand for digital medical solutions has been accelerated by the need for new diagnostic and therapeutic methods in the current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. This also applies to clinical practice in gastroenterology, which has, in many respects, undergone a recent digital transformation with numerous consequences that will impact patients and health care professionals in the near future. MHAs and MAs are considered to have great potential, especially for chronic diseases, as they can support the self-management of patients in many ways. Despite the great potential associated with the application of MHAs and MAs in gastroenterology and health care in general, there are numerous challenges to be met in the future, including both the ethical and legal aspects of applying this technology. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the current status of MHA and MA use in the field of gastroenterology, describe the future perspectives in this field and point out some of the challenges that need to be addressed."
231,10052020058366,"Most antiviral agents are designed to target virus-specific proteins and mechanisms rather than the host cell proteins that are critically dysregulated following virus-mediated reprogramming of the host cell transcriptional state. To overcome these limitations, we propose that elucidation and pharmacologic targeting of host cell Master Regulator proteins—whose aberrant activities govern the reprogramed state of coronavirus-infected cells—presents unique opportunities to develop novel mechanism-based therapeutic approaches to antiviral therapy, either as monotherapy or as a complement to established treatments. Specifically, we propose that a small module of host cell Master Regulator proteins (ViroCheckpoint) is hijacked by the virus to support its efficient replication and release. Conventional methodologies are not well suited to elucidate these potentially targetable proteins. By using the VIPER network-based algorithm, we successfully interrogated 12h, 24h, and 48h signatures from Calu-3 lung adenocarcinoma cells infected with SARS-CoV, to elucidate the time-dependent reprogramming of host cells and associated Master Regulator proteins. We used the NYS CLIA-certified Darwin OncoTreat algorithm, with an existing database of RNASeq profiles following cell perturbation with 133 FDA-approved and 195 late-stage experimental compounds, to identify drugs capable of virtually abrogating the virus-induced Master Regulator signature. This approach to drug prioritization and repurposing can be trivially extended to other viral pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, as soon as the relevant infection signature becomes available."
232,10122020129776,"In the wake of the rapid surge in the Covid-19 infected cases seen in Southern and West-Central USA in the period of June-July 2020, there is an urgent need to develop robust, data-driven models to quantify the effect which early reopening had on the infected case count increase. In particular, it is imperative to address the question: How many infected cases could have been prevented, had the worst affected states not reopened early? To address this question, we have developed a novel Covid-19 model by augmenting the classical SIR epidemiological model with a neural network module. The model decomposes the contribution of quarantine strength to the infection timeseries, allowing us to quantify the role of quarantine control and the associated reopening policies in the US states which showed a major surge in infections. We show that the upsurge in the infected cases seen in these states is strongly co-related with a drop in the quarantine/lockdown strength diagnosed by our model. Further, our results demonstrate that in the event of a stricter lockdown without early reopening, the number of active infected cases recorded on 14 July could have been reduced by more than 40% in all states considered, with the actual number of infections reduced being more than 100,000 for the states of Florida and Texas. As we continue our fight against Covid-19, our proposed model can be used as a valuable asset to simulate the effect of several reopening strategies on the infected count evolution; for any region under consideration."
233,10092020095153,"The physiopathological mechanisms that regulate menopausal and sex differences in colonic transit, inflammatory processes and efficacy of treatments have not been clarified. The dopaminergic and renin-angiotensin systems (RAS) coexist in the gut and regulate different processes such as motility, absorption/secretion and inflammation. We investigated the changes in expression of major angiotensin and dopamine receptors in the colon of male, female and ovariectomized female mice. Possible interaction between both systems was investigated using male and female mice deficient (ko) for major angiotensin and dopamine receptors. In wild type mice, colonic tissue from females showed lower angiotensin type 1 (AT1)/angiotensin type 2 (AT2) ratio (an index of proinflammatory/anti-inflammatory RAS balance), lower dopamine D1 and D2 receptor expression, and lower levels of proinflammatory and pro-oxidative markers relative to males. Interestingly, ovariectomy increased the expression of pro-inflammatory AT1 receptor expression and decreased anti-inflammatory AT2 receptor expression, increased D1 and D2 receptor expression, and increased the levels of proinflammatory and pro-oxidative markers. Ovariectomy-induced changes were blocked by estrogen replacement. The present results suggest a mutual regulation between colonic angiotensin and dopamine receptors, and sex differences in this mutual regulation. Estrogen regulates changes in both angiotensin and dopamine receptor expression, which may be involved in sex- and surgical menopause-related effects on gut motility, permeability and vulnerability to inflammatory processes."
234,10142021021169,"The concept of ergodicity as described in the London Mathematical Laboratory seems very counterintuitive. Something is ergodic when its time average equals to its expectation value. Transferring this sentence into a more suitable real-life situation, one can say pooling and sharing earnings will increase one’s wealth steadily over time. One may wonder why should they cooperate with each other when they all have bad exterior conditions? Will cooperation not make everything worse? We developed a Business Simulation Game, New Rising of the Ylsung concept, which tests different parameters to visualize the concept of ergodicity. We distinguished that in most of the cases it brings a greater advantage to collaborate than to work by oneself. Moreover, the simulation helps high school students to understand the research of the London Mathematical Laboratory in a playful manner. Hence, they do not have to read research papers, but simply play through our Business Simulation Game while adjusting the parameter sets and analyzing the graphs. Our main aim is to find out to what extend the application of different parameters between cooperation and non-cooperation differ from each other and how the application of those looks in real-life scenarios."
235,10162021042837,"Protection of healthcare workers (HCWs) against influenza is essential for patient health and a functional health system. The study aimed to analyze the demand for seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) among various groups of HCWs in a tertiary care hospital before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify their motives for this season's SIV. Before this influenza season (2020/21), the hospital management offered free SIV to all HCWs and promoted it on the internal network. Out of 4,167 HCWs, 630 HCWs expressed interest in SIV and were vaccinated in the hospital. They filled in a total of 603 self-administered pen-and-paper questionnaires. The mean age of the respondents (374 females and 229 males) was 45 ± 12 years. Physicians accounted for 48% of the vaccinated persons but for only 24% (p < .001) of all HCWs to whom SIV was offered. Only 16% of respondents vaccinated this year also received SIV before the last season (2019/20), with the proportion of physicians (19%) being statistically significantly higher than that of non-physicians (13%, p = .045) and the proportion of chronically ill HCWs (22%) being higher than that of healthy individuals (13%, p = .004). Most frequently, respondents' motivation to get vaccinated this year was self-protection (61%), that is concerns about contracting influenza together with COVID-19 or alone, followed by family protection (58%) and patient protection (53%). In conclusion, COVID-19 contributed to an increased demand for SIV among HCWs and the threat of contracting it together with influenza was the most frequent motive."
236,10132021018129,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as the infectious agent causing the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with dramatic consequences for global human health and economics. Previously, we reached clinical evaluation with our vector vaccine based on vaccinia virus MVA against the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which causes an infection in humans similar to SARS and COVID-19. Here, we describe the construction and preclinical characterization of a recombinant MVA expressing full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein (MVA-SARS-2-S). Genetic stability and growth characteristics of MVA-SARS-2-S, plus its robust synthesis of S antigen, make it a suitable candidate vaccine for industrial scale production. Vaccinated mice produced S antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and serum antibodies binding to S glycoprotein that neutralized SARS-CoV-2. Prime-boost vaccination with MVA-SARS-2-S protected mice sensitized with a human ACE2-expressing adenovirus from SARS-CoV-2 infection. MVA-SARS-2-S is currently being investigated in a phase I clinical trial as aspirant for developing a safe and efficacious vaccine against COVID-19. Significance Statement The highly attenuated vaccinia virus MVA is licensed as smallpox vaccine, and as vector it is a component of the approved Adenovirus-MVA-based prime-boost vaccine against Ebola virus disease. Here we provide results from testing the COVID-19 candidate vaccine MVA-SARS-2-S, a poxvirus-based vector vaccine that proceeded to clinical evaluation. When administered by intramuscular inoculation, MVA-SARS-2-S expresses and safely delivers the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, inducing balanced SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular and humoral immunity, and protective efficacy in vaccinated mice. Substantial clinical experience has already been gained with MVA vectors using homologous and heterologous prime-boost applications, including the immunization of children and immunocompromised individuals. Thus, MVA-SARS-2-S represents an important resource for developing further optimized COVID-19 vaccines."

238,10122020126445,"COVID-19 testing has become a standard approach for estimating prevalence which then assist in public health decision making to contain and mitigate the spread of the disease. The sampling designs used are often biased in that they do not reflect the true underlying populations. For instance, individuals with strong symptoms are more likely to be tested than those with no symptoms. This results in biased estimates of prevalence (too high). Typical post-sampling corrections are not always possible. Here we present a simple bias correction methodology derived and adapted from a correction for publication bias in meta analysis studies. The methodology is general enough to allow a wide variety of customization making it more useful in practice. Implementation is easily done using already collected information. Via an example and a real dataset, we show that the bias corrections can provide dramatic reductions in estimation error."
239,10152021032872,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES This study aimed to compare anxiety, resilience, and depression between COVID-19 unit (confirmed patients and suspected patients) and non-COVID-19 unit nurses and assess their effects on depression. BACKGROUND Nurses working during the global pandemic are known to be physically and psychologically exhausted, and experience severe anxiety and depression. However, there is a lack of studies comparing anxiety and depression between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 unit nurses. DESIGN Descriptive research study. METHODS This study was conducted on 64 nurses who directly worked for more than a month in a COVID-19 unit of a general hospital with nationally designated negative-pressure isolation beds and 64 nurses working in a non-COVID-19 unit. Data were collected through questionnaires and were analysed using SPSS 25.0. Reporting of this research adheres to the STROBE guidelines. RESULTS Anxiety and depression were significantly higher in nurses working with patients suspected to have COVID-19 rather than nurses working with confirmed COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients. Resilience was significantly lower in suspected patient unit nurses than in COVID-19 unit nurses. Anxiety was the major factor predicting depression in both COVID-19 unit (confirmed patients and suspected patients) and non-COVID-19 unit nurses with 76.6%, 80.7%, and 63.6% explanatory power, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Among nurses working in COVID-19 units, suspected patients unit nurses had higher depression than confirmed patients unit nurses due to an unsafe facility environment, insufficient personal protective equipment, and unknown conditions of the patients. Thus, interventions which have a high impact on depression need to be provided to relieve anxiety. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE The nursing organisation must provide comprehensive support including coordinated shifts, internal motivation, incentives, up-to-date information, and clear infection prevention guidelines to relieve anxiety caused by exhaustive workload, uncertainty of infectious diseases, and lack of human and material resources."
240,10112020110455,"INTRODUCTION: Tropical diseases are public health problems affecting hundreds of millions of people globally. However, the development of adequate, affordable, and accessible treatments is mostly neglected, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality that could otherwise be averted. Leishmaniasis is one of the neglected tropical diseases caused by the obligate intracellular protozoan Leishmania parasite and transmitted by the bite of infected phlebotomine sandflies. No systematic review and meta-analysis has been done to identify the prevalence and risk factors of leishmaniasis to the authors’ knowledge. Therefore, the objective was to determine the prevalence and risk factors of human leishmaniasis in Ethiopia. METHODS: Eleven studies conducted in all regions of Ethiopia, which were fully accessible, written in any language, and original articles done on prevalence and risk factors of leishmaniasis, were included. STATA™ version 11.1 was used for statistical analysis. Chi-square, I(2), and p values were assessed to check heterogeneity. A random effects model with heterogeneity taken from an inverse-variance model was employed to estimate the pooled effect. Subgroup meta-analysis was computed to reduce random variations among each article’s point prevalence, and Egger and funnel plots were used to check for publication bias. RESULTS: The highest proportion of human leishmaniasis was reported from a study done in Amhara region (39.1%), and the lowest was reported from a survey done in Tigray (2.3%). The overall pooled prevalence of leishmaniasis was 9.13% (95% CI 5–13.27). Subgroup analysis by region revealed moderate heterogeneity (I(2) = 51.8%) in studies conducted in the Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples Region (SNNPR). The presence of hyraxes and being male were associated with an increased risk of human leishmaniasis. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of leishmaniasis in Ethiopia remains high (9.13%), with significant risk factors being male and the presence of hyraxes within a 300-m radius of the sleeping area."
241,10052020057055,"Abstract Background COVID-19 can manifest as a viral induced hyperinflammation with multi-organ involvement. Such patients often experience rapid deterioration and need for mechanical ventilation. Currently, no prospectively validated biomarker of impending respiratory failure is available. Objective We aimed to identify and prospectively validate biomarkers that allow the identification of patients in need of impending mechanical ventilation. Methods Patients with COVID-19 hospitalized from February 29th to April 09th, 2020 were analyzed for baseline clinical and laboratory findings at admission and during the disease. Data from 89 evaluable patients were available for the purpose of analysis comprising an initial evaluation cohort (n=40) followed by a temporally separated validation cohort (n=49). Results We identified markers of inflammation, LDH and creatinine as most predictive variables of respiratory failure in the evaluation cohort. Maximal interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels before intubation showed the strongest association with the need of mechanical ventilation followed by maximal CRP. Respective AUC values for IL-6 and CRP in the evaluation cohort were 0.97 and 0.86 and similar in the validation cohort 0.90 and 0.83. The calculated optimal cutoff values in the course of disease from the evaluation cohort (IL-6> 80 pg/ml and CRP> 97 mg/l) both correctly classified 80% of patients in the validation cohort regarding their risk of respiratory failure. Conclusion Maximal levels of IL-6 followed by CRP were highly predictive of the need for mechanical ventilation. This suggests the possibility of using IL-6 or CRP levels to guide escalation of treatment in patients with COVID-19 related hyperinflammatory syndrome."
242,10172021052425,"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has resulted in dramatic changes to the conduct of surgery both from a patient management perspective and in protecting healthcare providers. The current study reports on the status of COVID-19 infections in patients presenting for cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on circuit complications. A tracking process for monitoring the presence of COVID-19 in adult cardiac surgery patients was integrated into a case documentation system across United States hospitals where out-sourced perfusion services were provided. Assessment included infection status, testing technique employed, surgery status and CPB complications. Records from 5612 adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery between November 1, 2020 and January 18, 2021 from 176 hospitals were reviewed. A sub-cohort of coronary artery bypass graft patients (3283) was compared using a mixed effect binary logistic regression analysis. 4297 patients had negative test results (76.6%) while 49 (0.9%) tested positive for COVID-19, and unknown or no results were reported in 693 (12.4%) and 573 (10.2%) respectively. Coagulation complications were reported at 0.2% in the negative test results group versus 4.1% in the positive test result group (p < 0.001). Oxygenator gas exchange complications were 0.2% in the negative test results group versus 2.0% in the positive test results group (p = 0.088). Coronary artery bypass graft patients with a positive test had significantly higher risk for any CPB complication (p = 0.003) [OR 10.38, CI 2.18-49.53] then negative test patients [OR 0.01, CI 0.00-0.20]. The present study has shown that patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB who test positive for COVID-19 have higher CPB complication rate than those who test negative."
243,101320210112969,"Influenza virus and coronavirus, belonging to enveloped RNA viruses, are major causes of human respiratory diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the broad spectrum antiviral activity of a naturally existing sulfated polysaccharide, lambda-carrageenan (λ-CGN), purified from marine red algae. Cell culture-based assays revealed that the macromolecule efficiently inhibited both influenza A and B viruses with EC(50) values ranging from 0.3 to 1.4 μg/ml, as well as currently circulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with an EC(50) value of 0.9 ± 1.1 μg/ml. No toxicity to the host cells was observed at concentrations up to 300 μg/ml. Plaque titration and western blot analysis verified that λ-CGN reduced expression of viral proteins in cell lysates and suppressed progeny virus production in culture supernatants in a dose-dependent manner. This polyanionic compound exerts antiviral activity by targeting viral attachment to cell surface receptors and preventing virus entry. Moreover, its intranasal administration to mice during influenza A viral challenge not only alleviated infection-mediated reductions in body weight but also protected 60% of mice from virus-induced mortality. Thus, λ-CGN could be a promising antiviral agent for preventing infection with several respiratory viruses."
244,10092020099769,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has brought a great deal of pressure for medical students, who typically show elevated anxiety rates. Our aim is to investigate the prevalence of anxiety in medical students during this pandemic. This systematic review and mini meta-analysis has been conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. Two researchers independently searched PubMed on 26 August 2020 for cross-sectional studies on medical students during the COVID-19 outbreak, with no language restrictions applied. We then performed a manual search to detect other potentially eligible investigations. To the 1361 records retrieved in the initial search, 4 more were added by manual search on medRxiv. Finally, eight studies were finally included for qualitative and quantitative analysis, which yielded an estimated prevalence of anxiety of 28% (95% CI: 22–34%), with significant heterogeneity between studies. The prevalence of anxiety in medical students is similar to that prior to the pandemic but correlates with several specific COVID-related stressors. While some preventive and risk factors have been previously identified in a non-pandemic context, knowledge and cognitions on COVID-19 transmission, treatment, prognosis and prevention negatively correlate with anxiety, emerging as a key preventive factor that may provide a rationale for why the levels of anxiety have remained stable in medical students during the pandemic while increasing in their non-medical peers and the general population. Other reasons for the invariability of anxiety rates in this population are discussed. A major limitation of our review is that Chinese students comprised 89% the total sample, which could compromise the external validity of our work"
245,10102020100847,"In this chapter, we focus on the status of women’s representation in Japan at national and local levels of government, notably by tracing women’s numerical presence or descriptive representation (Pitkin in The concept of representation. Atherton Press, New York, NY, 1967) in the postwar period. We discuss how gender bias against women manifests through micro and macro, socio-cultural and institutional, contexts of local and national politics, and, notably, the pervasive impact and hegemony of elite men’s social and political capital within electoral political and political party recruitment strategies. In particular, we explore the key gatekeeping mechanisms restricting women’s baseline access to political leadership and the absence of an equal playing field in Japanese politics. We discuss recent feminist activism in favor of diversifying decision-making within Japan and propose next steps for expanding the windows of opportunity for women’s political leadership."
246,10142021022460,"The field of bereavement research and care is at a tipping point. The introduction of prolonged grief disorder (PGD) in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) has ignited clinical interest in this new disorder, along with debate over challenges in validating and implementing these new criteria. At the same time, the global COVID-19 pandemic has launched several local and international efforts to provide urgent support and comfort for individuals and communities suffering from grief. Recently, grief experts have called for a collective response to these complicated bereavements and possible increase in PGD due to COVID-19. Here we outline a new European network that aims to unite a community of grief researchers and clinicians to provide accessible, evidence-based support particularly during times of unprecedent crisis. The Bereavement Network Europe (BNE) has been developed with two main aims. Firstly, to develop expert agreed, internationally acceptable guidelines for bereavement care through a three-tiered approach. Secondly, to provide a platform for researchers and clinicians to share knowledge, collaborate, and develop consensus protocols to facilitate the introduction of PGD to diverse stakeholders. This article outlines the current status and aims of the BNE along with the plans for upcoming network initiatives and the three-tiered bereavement care guidelines in response to the COVID-19 pandemic."
247,100920200911537,"Abstract Introduction: Following the USA, India ranks the second position in the world for COVID 19 cases with the highest number of daily confirmed cases since September 2020. The peak of COVID-19 cases is the most warranted feature for understanding the curvature of COVID 19 cases. Aim: This study aims to analyse the growth rates of the daily confirmed cases and to provide an expected count of the peak of daily confirmed cases. Data: We retrieved data from an Application Programming Interface portal https://www.covid19india.org/ which is open access and publicly available. Methods: Exponential model was applied to estimate the growth rates of daily confirmed cases. The estimated growth rates were used for calculating the doubling time. The Lotka Euler method was applied to calculate the effective reproduction rate. SARIMA model was developed for the growth rates to predict daily confirmed cases. Results: Results show the best fit of the exponential model over the daily confirmed cases. The growth rates estimated from the exponential model shows an unsteady, modest decline. Doubling time shows a linear increase. The effective reproduction rate declined from 3.6 persons in the third week of March 2020 to 1.14 persons at the end of August 2020. The diagnosis of the developed SARIMA model confirmed no trends in the residuals, no outliers, and nearly constant variance. The forecast suggests the peak value of daily confirmed cases would waver around 105,000 counts in the last week of September 2020. The cumulative COVID-19 cases would account for approximately 105 lakhs at the end of December 2020. Conclusion: The exponential model unravels a shift and a modest decline in the growth of daily confirmed cases. The trends in R(t) show analogue with the trends in growth rates of daily confirmed cases. The study shows that the SARIMA model is suitable for projecting daily confirmed cases. The results shed light on the understanding of the trends and epidemiological stage of COVID-19 disease, in the cognisance of the peak. Contribution: This study based on moments of the distribution of the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 disease unravels the uncertainty about the peak and curvature of COVID-19 disease.

249,10132021014713,"What is the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the 2020 US presidential election? Guided by a pre-analysis plan, we estimate the effect of COVID-19 cases and deaths on the change in county-level voting for Donald Trump between 2016 and 2020. To account for potential confounders, we include a large number of COVID-19-related controls as well as demographic and socioeconomic variables. Moreover, we instrument the numbers of cases and deaths with the share of workers employed in meat-processing factories to sharpen our identification strategy. We find that COVID-19 cases negatively affected Trump’s vote share. The estimated effect appears strongest in urban counties, in states without stay-at-home orders, in swing states, and in states that Trump won in 2016. A simple counterfactual analysis suggests that Trump would likely have won re-election if COVID-19 cases had been 5 percent lower. We also find some evidence that COVID-19 incidence had a positive effect on voters’ mobilization, helping Biden win the presidency."
250,10162021047797,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is especially severe in aged populations(1). Resolution of the COVID-19 pandemic has been advanced by the recent development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, but vaccine efficacy is partly compromised by the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with enhanced transmissibility(2). The emergence of these variants emphasizes the need for further development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies, especially in aged populations. Here, we describe the isolation of a new set of highly virulent mouse-adapted viruses and use them to test a novel therapeutic drug useful in infections of aged animals. Initially, we show that many of the mutations observed in SARS-CoV-2 during mouse adaptation (at positions 417, 484, 501 of the spike protein) also arise in humans in variants of concern (VOC)(2). Their appearance during mouse adaptation indicates that immune pressure is not required for their selection. Similar to the human infection, aged mice infected with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 develop more severe disease than young mice. In murine SARS, in which severity is also age-dependent, we showed that elevated levels of an eicosanoid, prostaglandin D2 (PGD(2)) and of a phospholipase, PLA(2)G2D, contributed to poor outcomes in aged mice(3,4). Using our virulent mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2, we show that infection of middle-aged mice lacking expression of DP1, a PGD(2) receptor, or PLA(2)G2D are protected from severe disease. Further, treatment with a DP1 antagonist, asapiprant, protected aged mice from a lethal infection. DP1 antagonism is one of the first interventions in SARS-CoV-2-infected animals that specifically protects aged animals, and demonstrates that the PLA(2)G2D-PGD(2)/DP1 pathway is a useful target for therapeutic interventions."
251,101020201010336,"COVID-19 has become a pandemic in the United States and worldwide. COVID-19-induced coagulopathy (CIC) is commonly encountered at presentation manifested by considerable elevation of D-dimer and fibrin split products but with modest or no change in activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time. CIC is a complex process that is distinctly different from conventional sepsis-induced coagulopathy. The cytokine storm induced by COVID-19 infection appears to be more severe in COVID-19, resulting in development of extensive micro- and macrovascular thrombosis and organ failure. Unlike conventional sepsis, anticoagulation plays a key role in the treatment of COVID-19, however without practice guidelines tailored to these patients. We propose a scoring system for COVID-19-coagulopathy (CIC Scoring) and stratification of patients for the purpose of anticoagulation therapy based on risk categories. The proposed scoring system and therapeutic guidelines are likely to undergo revisions in the future as new data become available in this evolving field."
252,100820200810201,"The new coronavirus (COVID‐19) was first reported in Wuhan in China, on 31 December 2019. COVID‐19 is a new virus from the family of coronaviruses that can cause symptoms ranging from a simple cold to pneumonia. The virus is thought to bind to the angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2, as a well‐known mechanism to enter the cell. It then transfers its DNA to the host in which the virus replicates the DNA. The viral infection leads to severe lack of oxygen, lung oxidative stress because of reactive oxygen species generation, and overactivation of the immune system by activating immune mediators. The purpose of this review is to elaborate on the more precise mechanism(s) to manage the treatment of the disease. Regarding the mechanisms of the virus action, the suggested pharmacological and nutritional regimens have been described."
253,10042020046181,"While the basic mechanisms of flavivirus entry and fusion are understood, little is known about the postfusion events that precede RNA replication, such as nucleocapsid disassembly. We describe here a sensitive, conditionally replication-defective yellow fever virus (YFV) entry reporter, YFVΔSK/Nluc, to quantitively monitor the translation of incoming, virus particle-delivered genomes. We validated that YFVΔSK/Nluc gene expression can be neutralized by YFV-specific antisera and requires known flavivirus entry pathways and cellular factors, including clathrin- and dynamin-mediated endocytosis, endosomal acidification, YFV E glycoprotein-mediated fusion, and cellular LY6E and RPLP1 expression. The initial round of YFV translation was shown to require cellular ubiquitylation, consistent with recent findings that dengue virus capsid protein must be ubiquitylated in order for nucleocapsid uncoating to occur. Importantly, translation of incoming YFV genomes also required valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97, a cellular ATPase that unfolds and extracts ubiquitylated client proteins from large complexes. RNA transfection and washout experiments showed that VCP/p97 functions at a postfusion, pretranslation step in YFV entry. Finally, VCP/p97 activity was required by other flaviviruses in mammalian cells and by YFV in mosquito cells. Together, these data support a critical role for VCP/p97 in the disassembly of incoming flavivirus nucleocapsids during a postfusion step in virus entry."

256,10152021039927,"Hospitals consume most of the health systems' financial resources. In Portugal, for instance, public hospitals represent more than half of the National Health Service debt and are decisive in their financial insufficiency. Although profit is not the primary goal of hospitals, it is essential to guarantee their financial sustainability to ensure users' health care and the necessary resources. An analysis of the existing literature shows that researches focus mainly on the hospital's technical efficiency. The literature has paid little or even no attention to the use of composite indicators in hospital benchmarking studies. This study uses the Benefit of Doubt methodology alongside recent data about Portuguese public hospitals (2013–2017) to understand the factors that contribute to low performance and high indebtedness levels. Our results suggest that hospitals perform better in terms of access (average score: 0.982). The group of criteria with the lowest performance was efficiency and productivity (average score: 0.919), suggesting resources waste. Financial performance is, in general, higher than quality, raising social concerns about the way that public hospitals have been managed. Findings bring relevant implications. For example, the way hospitals are currently financed should consider efficiency, productivity, quality, and access. Regulators should ensure that minimum performance levels are fulfilled, applying preventive and corrective measures to avoid future low-performance levels. We suggest that hospital managers introduce satisfaction inquiries to improve quality. These improvements can attract more patients in the medium- or long-term; thus, our results are useful to citizens to make a better choice."
257,10092020091335,"Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for tracking glymphatic system transport with paramagnetic contrast such as gadoteric acid (Gd-DOTA) administration into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) requires pre-contrast data for proper quantification. Here we introduce an alternative approach for glymphatic system quantification in the mouse brain via T1 mapping which also captures drainage of Gd-DOTA to the cervical lymph nodes. The Gd-DOTA injection into CSF was performed on the bench after which the mice underwent T1 mapping using a 3D spoiled gradient echo sequence on a 9.4 T MRI. In Ketamine/Xylazine (KX) anesthetized mice, glymphatic transport and drainage of Gd-DOTA to submandibular and deep cervical lymph nodes was demonstrated as 25-50% T1 reductions in comparison to control mice receiving CSF saline. To further validate the T1 mapping approach we also verified increased glymphatic transport of Gd-DOTA transport in mice anesthetized with KX in comparison with ISO. The novel T1 mapping method allows for quantification of glymphatic transport as well as drainage to the deep and superficial cervical lymph nodes. The ability to measure glymphatic transport and cervical lymph node drainage in the same animal longitudinally is advantageous and time efficient and the coupling between the two systems can be studied and translated to human studies."
258,101620210410042,"The pandemic, due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has stimulated the search for antivirals to tackle COVID-19 infection. Molecules with known pharmacokinetics and already approved for human use have been demonstrated or predicted to be suitable to be used either directly or as a base for a scaffold-based drug design. Among these substances, quercetin is known to be a potent in vitro inhibitor of 3CLpro, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. However, its low in vivo bioavailability calls for modifications to its molecular structure. In this work, this issue is addressed by using rutin, a natural flavonoid that is the most common glycosylated conjugate of quercetin, as a model. Combining experimental (spectroscopy and calorimetry) and simulation techniques (docking and molecular dynamics simulations), we demonstrate that the sugar adduct does not hamper rutin binding to 3CLpro, and the conjugated compound preserves a high potency (inhibition constant in the low micromolar range, K(i) = 11 μM). Although showing a disruption of the pseudo-symmetry in the chemical structure, a larger steric volume and molecular weight, and a higher solubility compared to quercetin, rutin is able to associate in the active site of 3CLpro, interacting with the catalytic dyad (His41/Cys145). The overall results have implications in the drug-design of quercetin analogs, and possibly other antivirals, to target the catalytic site of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro."
259,10162021049962,"Social vulnerability indicators are a valuable tool for understanding which population groups are more vulnerable to experiencing negative impacts from disasters, and where these groups live, to inform disaster risk management activities. While many approaches have been used to measure social vulnerability to natural hazards, there is no single method or universally agreed approach. This paper proposes a novel approach to developing social vulnerability indicators, using the example of flooding in Aotearoa New Zealand. A conceptual framework was developed to guide selection of the social vulnerability indicators, based on previous frameworks (including the MOVE framework), consideration of climate change, and a holistic view of health and wellbeing. Using this framework, ten dimensions relating to social vulnerability were identified: exposure; children; older adults; health and disability status; money to cope with crises/losses; social connectedness; knowledge, skills and awareness of natural hazards; safe, secure and healthy housing; food and water to cope with shortage; and decision making and participation. For each dimension, key indicators were identified and implemented, mostly using national Census population data. After development, the indicators were assessed by end users using a case study of Porirua City, New Zealand, then implemented for the whole of New Zealand. These indicators will provide useful data about social vulnerability to floods in New Zealand, and these methods could potentially be adapted for other jurisdictions and other natural hazards, including those relating to climate change."
260,10082020084087,"BACKGROUND A form of telehealth, a surgical electronic clinic (E-clinic, video or telephone visit) is a safe and efficient way for delivering care; however, factors leading to poor clinic utilization are not well-described. This study was performed to gather electronic clinic utilization data and to better define barriers to visit completion. METHODS A retrospective review of 199 patients cared for by a general surgery service with subsequent referral to the electronic clinic (January 2019 to June 2019) was performed. Data regarding demographics, medical characteristics, travel distance, and postoperative complications were collected. Patients were categorized based upon visit completion. The χ2 and Fisher exact analyses were performed as appropriate. Reasons for cancellations were categorized. RESULTS More than 1/5 of all patients (21.6%) failed to complete the visit. No differences were observed in completion rates according to the type of operation, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, and age. The failed-completion group had a significantly (P < .05) higher proportion of non-Caucasian patients and those with a marital status of single. Travel distance had no impact. Complication rates were low. Pre-clinic readmission within 30 days contributed to failed completion. Reasons for cancellation included medical issues, technical difficulties, and patient preference to have no follow-up in the electronic clinic. CONCLUSION Several factors contribute to a patient's failure to complete an electronic clinic visit including marital status, medical complications, technical issues, and patient preference. Electronic clinic utilization patterns also demonstrate racial disparities. Successful electronic clinic program implementation requires understanding the factors that contribute to failed visits to address them and improve access."
261,10122020122623,"Recent World Health Organization guidance has aimed to provide pragmatic guidance acknowledging the role of sequential nasopharyngeal swabs taken >24 hours apart for SARS-CoV-2 in high-risk populations. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are known to have an altered immune milieu which may be associated with a delay in viral clearance. Here, a cross-sectional observational study of 138 patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection at two large regional hospitals in Scotland, UK examined the median time to two consecutive negative nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 in an inpatient population. The median time from admission to the first of two consecutive negative nasopharyngeal swabs was 18 days (range = 1-44) in patients with CKD, compared with 11 days (range: 1-71) in patients without CKD (P = .0007). Multivariable linear regression analysis using explanatory variables of age, sex, SARS-CoV-2 disease severity, key comorbidities and renal function showed that declining estimated glomerular filtration rate was independently associated with prolonged time to viral clearance. Our data suggest that patients with CKD who are admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV-2 take longer to achieve sequential negative nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results than those without CKD. This has implications for renal service provision, discharge planning and hospital capacity as well as a direct impact on patients due to extended hospital stay, anxiety and stigmatisation."
262,10062020065223,BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether MS disease modifying therapies impact ability to mount an antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Case series and literature review. We report a series of two MS patients who developed COVID-19 while on Ocrelizumab therapy and subsequently exhibited negative SARS-CoV-2 serology. RESULTS: A 42-year-old man and 39-year-old woman with MS developed COVID-19 while on Ocrelizumab therapy. Neither patient required hospitalization. The man exhibited negative serology at 7- and 9-weeks post-infection. The woman exhibited negative serology at 6- and 12-weeks post-infection. CONCLUSIONS: Large studies are essential to determine whether certain DMTs may blunt SARS-CoV-2 antibody production.

264,10112020114633,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has seen the emergence of unsubstantiated claims by vertebral subluxation-based chiropractors that spinal manipulative therapy has a role to play in prevention by enhancing the body’s immune function. We contend that these claims are unprofessional and demonstrate a disturbing lack of insight into the doctrine of informed consent. As such it is timely to review how informed consent has evolved and continues to do so and also to discuss the attendant implications for contemporary health practitioner practice. We review the origins of informed consent and trace the duty of disclosure and materiality through landmark medical consent cases in four common law (case law) jurisdictions. The duty of disclosure has evolved from a patriarchal exercise to one in which patient autonomy in clinical decision making is paramount. Passing time has seen the duty of disclosure evolve to include non-medical aspects that may influence the delivery of care. We argue that a patient cannot provide valid informed consent for the removal of vertebral subluxation. Further, vertebral subluxation care cannot meet code of conduct standards because it lacks an evidence base and is practitioner-centered. The uptake of the expanded duty of disclosure has been slow and incomplete by practitioners and regulators. The expanded duty of disclosure has implications, both educative and punitive for regulators, chiropractic educators and professional associations. We discuss how practitioners and regulators can be informed by other sources such as consumer law. For regulators, reviewing and updating informed consent requirements is required. For practitioners it may necessitate disclosure of health status, conflict of interest when recommending “inhouse” products, recency of training after attending continuing professional development, practice patterns, personal interests and disciplinary findings. CONCLUSION: Ultimately such matters are informed by the deliberations of the courts. It is our opinion that the duty of a mature profession to critically self-evaluate and respond in the best interests of the patient before these matters arrive in court."
265,10132021012362,"This study aimed to examine the associations between perceived coronavirus risk, coronavirus fear, mental well-being and parental coronavirus anxiety, as well as the mediating role of coronavirus fear and moderating role of mental well-being. The sample comprised 189 healthcare workers (M = 33.06 ± 6.92), who were treating patients with COVID-19 in a pandemic hospital in Turkey. Ninety-one participants were males and 98 females. Participants completed measures of perceived coronavirus risk, coronavirus fear, mental well-being and parental coronavirus anxiety. Parental Coronavirus Anxiety Scale had a one-factor structure, with satisfactory reliability. Main findings showed that coronavirus fear mediated the relationship between coronavirus risk and parental coronavirus anxiety. Mental well-being moderated the effect of coronavirus risk on parental coronavirus anxiety. The mediation effect of coronavirus fear was moderated by mental well-being. These findings explain why and when mental well-being-based interventions could be effective in reducing perceived coronavirus risk, fear and parental coronavirus anxiety about their children."
266,100520200511684,"Abstract: Objective We sought to describe the medical history and clinical findings of patients attending the ED with suspected COVID-19 and estimate the diagnostic accuracy of patients’ characteristics for predicting COVID-19. Methods We prospectively enrolled all patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in our ED from March 9, 2020 to April 4, 2020. We abstracted medical history, physical examination findings, and the clinical probability of COVID-19 (“low”, “moderate”, “high”) rated by emergency physicians depending on their clinical judgment. We assessed diagnostic accuracy of these characteristics for COVID-19 by calculating positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+/LR-). Results We included 391 patients of whom 225 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. RT-PCR was more likely to be negative when the emergency physician thought that clinical probability was low, and more likely to be positive when she or he thought that clinical probability was high. Patient-reported anosmia and the presence of bilateral B-lines on lung ultrasound had the highest LR+ for the diagnosis of COVID-19 (7.58; 95% CI 2.36–24.36 and 7.09; 95% CI 2.77–18.12 respectively). The absence of a high clinical probability determined by the emergency physician and the absence of bilateral B-lines on lung ultrasound had the lowest LR- for the diagnosis of COVID-19 (0.33; 95% CI 0.25–0.43 and 0.26; 95% CI 0.15–0.45 respectively). Conclusions Anosmia, emergency physician estimate of high clinical probability and bilateral B-lines on lung ultrasound increased the likelihood of identifying COVID-19 in patients presenting to the ED."
267,10082020083930,"Following the publication of the Italian Ministerial recommendations relating to dentistry in Phase 2 of the COVID-19 pandemic (focusing on operational protocols for all dental staff), we believe that the patient/dentist relationship should increasingly take into account the heightened fears and anxious thoughts of patients. This particularly regards patients who are about to undergo dental work. Moreover, dentists should also pay close attention to recent events, which have determined the new recommendations regarding SARS-COV-2 biocontainment. Furthermore, the authors of this paper consider it appropriate to make suggestions and develop interventionist techniques regarding the interface with the patient starting from the initial consultation. The latter is invariably determinant in establishing clear communication of the Ministerial recommendations in encouraging a relaxed atmosphere with the patient. This interface is also a decisive factor in promoting patient empowerment, including specifying the time period envisaged for treatment in the new COVID-19 era in as calm a manner as possible. Such an approach will have a positive impact on the dentistry team."
268,10172021054054,"INTRODUCTION The new type of coronavirus could cause severe acute respiratory syndrome and injuries in other systems as well. Multiple organ damage can occur rapidly in patients infected with COVID-19. Previous studies have shown that many laboratory biomarkers were not within the normal ranges in COVID-19 patients. We aimed to summarize laboratory parameters and the tumor markers in COVID-19 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS This is a retrospective cohort study conducted on 53 women between the ages of 19-85 years infected with COVID-19 at a training and research hospital between May 2020 and August 2020. RESULTS Of the 53 women, 16 (30.2%) had leukopenia. The mean C-reactive protein level was 18.42±59.33 mg/L. The mean procalcitonin level was 0.1±0.21 µg/L. The liver function tests were within normal limits. The mean creatinine level was 0.58±0.37 mg/dl. Elevated levels of AFP in 1 patient, elevated levels of CEA in 2 patients, elevated levels of CA125 in 4 patients, elevated levels of CA19-9 in 2 patients, and elevated levels of CA15-3 in 2 patients were detected. One of 4 patients who taken to the intensive care unit had elevated levels of AFP. In addition, 2 of 4 patients who taken to the intensive care unit had elevated levels of CA125 and CA15-3. Except AFP, levels of all tumor markers of the patient who died were high. CONCLUSIONS We found that COVID-19 had no effect on tumor markers (CA125, CA19-9, CA15-3, AFP, and CEA).

270,10072020077826,"BACKGROUND: The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is extensively impacting new and ongoing clinical trials of various medical products irrespective of indication. It has the potential to adverse effect not only in terms of recruitment and immediate patient care but is also likely to affect the data collection and analysis in the months to come. AIM: The aim was to illustrate the effect of COVID-19 on the clinical research in one of the research centers in low limited-resource country as Egypt and the management plan performed to decrease this adverse impact. METHODOLOGY: Secondary data were collected anonymously about the measures implemented to deal with the challenges of conducting the nine ongoing and new clinical researches during COVID-19 pandemic at Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University Research Institute-Clinical Research Center. RESULTS: Out of the 47 enrolled participants, thirty participants required investigational product (IP) dispensation during the remaining study period; 27 of them had their IP dispensed at site, and six participants who were from far away Governorate were not able to come to the center due to the partial lockdown and had their IP deliver through courier to their home. Safety laboratory assessment had performed at the site or local laboratory at their hometown. Virtual visit alternatives to in-person visits for communication and patient evaluation had been performed. Recruitment of new participants and opening new sites were stopped in many trials. In order to reduce the on-site activities, in particular, on-site monitoring, all monitoring visits were performed virtually. CONCLUSION: The adverse impact of COVID-19 pandemic on clinical trials could be lessening by active management plan."
271,10142021024011,"The classical Langevin Monte Carlo method looks for i.i.d. samples from a target distribution by descending along the gradient of the target distribution. It is popular partially due to its fast convergence rate. However, the numerical cost is sometimes high because the gradient can be hard to obtain. One approach to eliminate the gradient computation is to employ the concept of""ensemble"", where a large number of particles are evolved together so that the neighboring particles provide gradient information to each other. In this article, we discuss two algorithms that integrate the ensemble feature into LMC, and the associated properties. There are two sides of our discovery: 1. By directly surrogating the gradient using the ensemble approximation, we develop Ensemble Langevin Monte Carlo. We show that this method is unstable due to a potentially small denominator that induces high variance. We provide a counterexample to explicitly show this instability. 2. We then change the strategy and enact the ensemble approximation to the gradient only in a constrained manner, to eliminate the unstable points. The algorithm is termed Constrained Ensemble Langevin Monte Carlo. We show that, with a proper tuning, the surrogation takes place often enough to bring the reasonable numerical saving, while the induced error is still low enough for us to maintain the fast convergence rate, up to a controllable discretization and ensemble error. Such combination of ensemble method and LMC shed light on inventing gradient-free algorithms that produce i.i.d. samples almost exponentially fast."
272,10082020085399,"Saving lives or economy is a dilemma for epidemic control in most cities while smart-tracing technology raises people's privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a solution for the life-or-economy dilemma that does not require private data. We bypass the private-data requirement by suppressing epidemic transmission through a dynamic control on inter-regional mobility that only relies on Origin-Designation (OD) data. We develop DUal-objective Reinforcement-Learning Epidemic Control Agent (DURLECA) to search mobility-control policies that can simultaneously minimize infection spread and maximally retain mobility. DURLECA hires a novel graph neural network, namely Flow-GNN, to estimate the virus-transmission risk induced by urban mobility. The estimated risk is used to support a reinforcement learning agent to generate mobility-control actions. The training of DURLECA is guided with a well-constructed reward function, which captures the natural trade-off relation between epidemic control and mobility retaining. Besides, we design two exploration strategies to improve the agent's searching efficiency and help it get rid of local optimums. Extensive experimental results on a real-world OD dataset show that DURLECA is able to suppress infections at an extremely low level while retaining 76\% of the mobility in the city. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/anyleopeace/DURLECA/."
273,100920200910629,"Background Wearing facial masks, hand hygiene, and social distancing are highly recommended preventive measures against COVID-19. Masks and disinfectants are usually sold in community pharmacies that are supposed to undertake extreme precautions to avoid cross infection among clients. It is also their responsibility to play a prominent role in educating the community regarding this outbreak. Objectives To investigate the preparedness of private community pharmacies in Madinah, Saudi Arabia, for the COVID-19 outbreak with regard to safety measures, customer education, and quality of preventive aids sold by them. Methods One hundred pharmacies were visited by simulated clients. The availability of free hand disinfectants, masks, gloves, and customer educational aids as well as the measures employed to ensure maintenance of safe distances between customers were documented. The adherence of pharmacists and customers to safety precautions and the behavior of pharmacists against violators of regulations were also observed. Finally, the availability and quality of facial masks and hand disinfectants sold by these pharmacies was documented. Results Fifty-five pharmacies offered free hand disinfectants but only in three of them all customers used them. Only two pharmacies offered free disposable masks and temperature screening was available in only one pharmacy. Educational aids were found in 31 pharmacies and only 53 pharmacies used visual indicators for social distancing. Violation of wearing masks by pharmacy personnel and customers was seen in 34 and 87 pharmacies, respectively. Social distancing was violated in 64 pharmacies and intervention by staff was seen in only three of them. Finally, facial masks were available for sale in only 35 pharmacies, and in 23 of these, the quality was questionable; hand disinfectants were available in 84 pharmacies, and in 14 of these, the quality was unknown. Conclusions Community pharmacies in Madinah were short of registered, high-quality facial masks during the survey. Means to control the transmission of infection inside pharmacies were unsatisfactory. Society has shown poor compliance to preventive measures against COVID-19 infection and the role of community pharmacists in promoting compliance was found to be poor. The study reveals an unsatisfactory level of preparedness of Madinah community pharmacies for the pandemic."
274,10092020098477,"Globally, little evidence exists on transmission patterns of COVID-19. Recommendations to prevent infection include appropriate and frequent handwashing plus physical and social distancing. We conducted an exploratory observational study to assess compliance with these recommendations in selected transportation stations in Ghana. A one-hour audit of 45 public transport stations in the Greater Accra region was carried out between 27(th) and 29(th) March 2020. Using an adapted World Health Organization (WHO) hand hygiene assessment scale, the availability and use of handwashing facilities, social distancing, and ongoing public education on COVID-19 prevention measures were assessed, weighted and scored to determine the level of compliance of stations. Compliance with recommendations was categorized as “inadequate” “basic”, “intermediate” and “advanced”, based on the overall score. Majority (80%) of stations in Accra have at least one Veronica Bucket with flowing water and soap, but the number of washing places at each station is not adequate. Only a small minority (18%) of stations were communicating the need to wash hands frequently and appropriately, and to practice social/physical distancing while at the station. In most stations (95%), hand washing practice was either not observed, or only infrequently. Almost all stations (93%) did not have alcohol-based hand sanitizers available for public use, while social distancing was rarely practiced (only 2%). In over 90% of the stations, face masks were either not worn or only worn by a few passengers. Compliance with COVID-19 prevention measures was inadequate in 13 stations, basic in 16 stations, intermediate in 7 stations, and advanced in 9 stations. Compliance with COVID-19 prevention measures in public transportation stations in the Greater Accra region remains a challenge. Awareness creation should aim to elevate COVID-19 risk perception of transportation operators and clients. Transport operators and stations need support and guidance to enforce hand washing and social distancing."
275,10062020063652,"High throughput sequencing is currently revolutionizing the genomics field and providing new approaches to the detection and characterization of microorganisms. The objective of this study was to assess the detection of influenza D virus (IDV) in bovine respiratory tract samples using two sequencing platforms (MiSeq and Nanopore (GridION)), and species-specific qPCR. An IDV-specific qPCR was performed on 232 samples (116 nasal swabs and 116 tracheal washes) that had been previously subject to virome sequencing using MiSeq. Nanopore sequencing was performed on 19 samples positive for IDV by either MiSeq or qPCR. Nanopore sequence data was analyzed by two bioinformatics methods: What’s In My Pot (WIMP, on the EPI2ME platform), and an in-house developed analysis pipeline. The agreement of IDV detection between qPCR and MiSeq was 82.3%, between qPCR and Nanopore was 57.9% (in-house) and 84.2% (WIMP), and between MiSeq and Nanopore was 89.5% (in-house) and 73.7% (WIMP). IDV was detected by MiSeq in 14 of 17 IDV qPCR-positive samples with Cq (cycle quantification) values below 31, despite multiplexing 50 samples for sequencing. When qPCR was regarded as the gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of MiSeq sequence detection were 28.3% and 98.9%, respectively. We conclude that both MiSeq and Nanopore sequencing are capable of detecting IDV in clinical specimens with a range of Cq values. Sensitivity may be further improved by optimizing sequence data analysis, improving virus enrichment, or reducing the degree of multiplexing."
276,10122020124252,"There has been growing concern about high risk of airborne infection during wind instrument performance as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves. In collaboration with 16 musicians from the Minnesota Orchestra, we employ multiple experimental and numerical techniques to quantify the airflow and aerosol concentration emitted from ten wind instruments under realistic performance conditions. For all instruments, the extent of the flow and aerosol influence zones are limited to 30 cm. Further away, the thermal plume generated by the human body is the dominant source of flow. Flow and aerosol concentration vary in response to changes in music amplitude, pitch, and note duration, depending on playing technique and instrument geometry. Covering the trumpet bell with speaker cloth and placing filters above the instrument outlet can substantially reduce the aerosol concentration. Our findings indicate that with appropriate risk mitigation strategies, musical instrument performance can be conducted with low risk of airborne disease transmission."

279,101020201011028,"The challenge of learning a new concept, object, or a new medical disease recognition without receiving any examples beforehand is called Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL). One of the major issues in deep learning based methodologies such as in Medical Imaging and other real-world applications is the requirement of large annotated datasets prepared by clinicians or experts to train the model. ZSL is known for having minimal human intervention by relying only on previously known or trained concepts plus currently existing auxiliary information. This is ever-growing research for the cases where we have very limited or no annotated datasets available and the detection [Formula: see text] recognition system has human-like characteristics in learning new concepts. This makes the ZSL applicable in many real-world scenarios, from unknown object detection in autonomous vehicles to medical imaging and unforeseen diseases such as COVID-19 Chest X-Ray (CXR) based diagnosis. In this review paper, we introduce a novel and broaden solution called Few [Formula: see text] one-shot learning, and present the definition of the ZSL problem as an extreme case of the few-shot learning. We review over fundamentals and the challenging steps of Zero-Shot Learning, including state-of-the-art categories of solutions, as well as our recommended solution, motivations behind each approach, their advantages over each category to guide both clinicians and AI researchers to proceed with the best techniques and practices based on their applications. Inspired from different settings and extensions, we then review through different datasets inducing medical and non-medical images, the variety of splits, and the evaluation protocols proposed so far. Finally, we discuss the recent applications and future directions of ZSL. We aim to convey a useful intuition through this paper towards the goal of handling complex learning tasks more similar to the way humans learn. We mainly focus on two applications in the current modern yet challenging era: coping with an early and fast diagnosis of COVID-19 cases, and also encouraging the readers to develop other similar AI-based automated detection [Formula: see text] recognition systems using ZSL."
280,10162021046489,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects human cells upon binding of its spike (S) glycoproteins to ACE2 receptors and causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Therapeutic approaches to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection are mostly focused on blocking S-ACE2 binding, but critical residues that stabilize this interaction are not well understood. By performing all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we identified an extended network of salt bridges, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonding between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein and ACE2. Mutagenesis of these residues on the RBD was not sufficient to destabilize binding but reduced the average work to unbind the S protein from ACE2. In particular, the hydrophobic end of RBD serves as the main anchor site and unbinds last from ACE2 under force. We propose that blocking the hydrophobic surface of RBD via neutralizing antibodies could prove an effective strategy to inhibit S-ACE2 interactions."
281,101520210310910,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of a prevention strategy against the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection among dental hospital staff over a 3-month period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effectiveness of the prevention strategy, which adopted healthcare staff protective measures, including patient triage and correct usage of personal preventive equipment, was evaluated by SARS-CoV-2 detection and serological testing. Patients who visited the Affiliated Stomatology Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China, between January 31 and March 1 (lockdown period) and March 2 and April 27 (reopening period) in 2020 and in the same period in 2019 were included in the study. Patients’ diagnosis, age, gender, and several undergoing aerosol-generating procedures during the study period were collected from the hospital’s database. Corresponding data were compared year-on-year (2020-on-2019). A total of 757 hospital staff underwent SARS-CoV-2 detection and serological testing on April 28–29, 2020. RESULTS: During the lockdown and reopening period in 2020, the number of hospital visits was dramatically decreased to about 6% and 58%, respectively, compared with the same period in 2019. However, emergency visits were increased 16- and 6.4-fold. A total of at least 6654 patients (13.58%) underwent aerosol-generating procedures during the study period in the year 2020. All hospital staff were negative according to SARS-CoV-2 detection and serological testing (IgG, IgM) data. CONCLUSION: During the study period in 2020, the total number of hospital visits dramatically reduced but emergency visits significantly increased. The prevention strategy implemented successfully prevented SARS-CoV-2 infection spread among healthcare workers in a dental hospital. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The prevention strategy indicated patient triage and how to adopt preventive measures for controlling SARS-CoV-2 spread among healthcare workers. These data can be used as a reference for other sectors suffering from the COVID-19 pandemic.

282,10092020097744,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the use of social network analysis to understand public discourse on Twitter around the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We examined different network properties that might affect the successful dissemination by and adoption of public health messages from public health officials and health agencies. METHODS: We focused on conversations on Twitter during 3 key communication events from late January to early June of 2020. We used Netlytic, a Web-based software that collects publicly available data from social media sites such as Twitter. RESULTS: We found that the network of conversations around COVID-19 is highly decentralized, fragmented, and loosely connected; these characteristics can hinder the successful dissemination of public health messages in a network. Competing conversations and misinformation can hamper risk communication efforts in a way that imperil public health. CONCLUSIONS: Looking at basic metrics might create a misleading picture of the effectiveness of risk communication efforts on social media if not analyzed within the context of the larger network. Social network analysis of conversations on social media should be an integral part of how public health officials and agencies plan, monitor, and evaluate risk communication efforts."

With the COVID-19 pandemic, there is heightened interest in safe and effective vaccines and their use in the context of clinical oncology practice. OBJECTIVES This article provides foundational information about vaccines in general and vaccines developed to protect against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the United States, as well as clinical nurse strategies to apply vaccines in clinical oncology practice. METHODS The article is based on a review of public health literature and reputable websites about vaccines and their development in clinical care. FINDINGS This foundational information about vaccines reviews their history and development, as well as the development of COVID-19 vaccines specifically, and discusses COVID-19 vaccines as part of clinical oncology care. Supporting best practices in clinical oncology care, nurses can provide factual, evidence-based information about vaccine safety, effectiveness, and safe administration."
284,10162021040946,"INTRODUCTION: COVID19 has stressed and stretched healthcare resources to the limit, thus the rational deployment of any resource should be necessary and of patient benefit. This retrospective audit aims to ascertain if a policy of two valid group and save tests prior to transurethral prostate surgery is necessary and if this resource can be redistributed safely during the ongoing pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective review of electronic patient records for patients that underwent transurethral prostate surgery from June 2017 to June 2018. During a single admission for surgery it was identified how many pre-operative group and save tests, and if a post-operative blood transfusion patients underwent. RESULTS: 146 patients underwent transurethral prostate surgery between June 2017 to June 2018. 97 patients had two valid group and save tests prior to surgery. 49 patients did not have 2 valid group and save tests. 21 patients had expired tests, 20 had only one valid sample, and 8 had no group and save test at all. No patient underwent a blood transfusion during their admission for transurethral prostate surgery. CONCLUSION: This single centre study illustrates pre-operative group and save tests before transurethral prostate surgery are unnecessary as no patient required an associated blood transfusion during admission; and can safely be omitted. The clinical time and resource could be redirected elsewhere for greater patient benefit. £2855.00 of efficiency savings could be made foregoing unneeded group and save tests. A policy omitting pre-operative group and save before transurethral prostate surgery will be implemented under COVID19 pandemic conditions and re-audited in 6 months."
285,10092020098311,"Although numerous studies have investigated the determinants of users’ acceptance of online channels, little attention has been paid to the continuous usage of a direct bank. To address this research gap, we analysed data collected via semi-structured interviews and a survey questionnaire distributed in 2017 to a sample of Italian bank customers. Responses were evaluated using a different statistical methodology based on the Shapley Value regression analysis. In brief, user-friendliness and economic advantages appear to be more decisive at an early stage of adoption. Moreover, structural assurance mechanisms (e.g. clarifying security policies and guarantees) have a robust impact on keeping customers online and loyal to electronic channels. Surprisingly, accessibility and compatibility do not seem to be determinant factors."
286,101120201110078,"Spain has been one of the main global pandemic epicenters for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we analyzed >41 000 genomes (including >26 000 high-quality (HQ) genomes) downloaded from the GISAID repository, including 1 245 (922 HQ) sampled in Spain. The aim of this study was to investigate genome variation of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and reconstruct phylogeographic and transmission patterns in Spain. Phylogeographic analysis suggested at least 34 independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 to Spain at the beginning of the outbreak. Six lineages spread very successfully in the country, probably favored by super-spreaders, namely, A2a4 (7.8%), A2a5 (38.4%), A2a10 (2.8%), B3a (30.1%), and B9 (8.7%), which accounted for 87.9% of all genomes in the Spanish database. One distinct feature of the Spanish SARS-CoV-2 genomes was the higher frequency of B lineages (39.3%, mainly B3a+B9) than found in any other European country. While B3a, B9, (and an important sub-lineage of A2a5, namely, A2a5c) most likely originated in Spain, the other three haplogroups were imported from other European locations. The B3a strain may have originated in the Basque Country from a B3 ancestor of uncertain geographic origin, whereas B9 likely emerged in Madrid. The time of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of SARS-CoV-2 suggested that the first coronavirus entered the country around 11 February 2020, as estimated from the TMRCA of B3a, the first lineage detected in the country. Moreover, earlier claims that the D614G mutation is associated to higher transmissibility is not consistent with the very high prevalence of COVID-19 in Spain when compared to other countries with lower disease incidence but much higher frequency of this mutation (56.4% in Spain vs. 82.4% in rest of Europe). Instead, the data support a major role of genetic drift in modeling the micro-geographic stratification of virus strains across the country as well as the role of SARS-CoV-2 super-spreaders."

With more than a million death cases, this outbreak has already had a significant impact on the physical and mental wellbeing of mankind. Considerable amount of research is going on worldwide to find out effective drugs against the virus. Chloroquine phosphate, an antimalarial drug is currently used for the treatment. Studies on the harmful effects of chloroquine is in progress. India is rich in traditional medical practicing such as Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani etc. Ministry of AYUSH is trying to implement an interdisciplinary treatment encompassing all traditional methodologies. It is proven that Ashwagandha rasayana (Withania sominefera L.Dunal) has better functions than hydroxychloroquine .The ayurvedic formulations such as Sudarshan Ghanvati and Sanshamanivati are also used. The combination of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin is found to cure COVID-19 more effectively. Use of Tocilizumab is found to cure the respiratory disorders associated with COVID . Favilavir turns out to be yet another effective drug. The alternative medical system has effective prophylaxis and is considered better for the treatment of COVID-19. Ayurveda and yoga improve immunity thus maintaining good health.

290,10122020124534,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a worldwide devastating effect. The understanding of evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is of paramount importance for the COVID-19 control, combating, and prevention. Due to the rapid growth of both the number of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and the number of unique mutations, the phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genome isolates faces an emergent large-data challenge. We introduce a dimension-reduced $k$-means clustering strategy to tackle this challenge. We examine the performance and effectiveness of three dimension-reduction algorithms: principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP). By using four benchmark datasets, we found that UMAP is the best-suited technique due to its stable, reliable, and efficient performance, its ability to improve clustering accuracy, especially for large Jaccard distanced-based datasets, and its superior clustering visualization. The UMAP-assisted $k$-means clustering enables us to shed light on increasingly large datasets from SARS-CoV-2 genome isolates."
291,10062020063134,"OBJECTIVES The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global public health crisis, which elicits psychological problems in different population. This study is to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on mental health in the front-line staff. METHODS Patient Health Questionnare-9 (PHQ-9), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Fatigue Self-assessment Scale (FSAS) were used to assess the depression, anxiety, and fatigue in front-line staff. RESULTS The detection rates of depression, anxiety, and fatigue were 49.1%, 21.8%, and 76.0% among the front-line staff. The rates of depression, anxiety, and fatigue in community workers were higher than those in medical workers and other occupational staff (P<0.01). The PHQ-9 of front-line staffs was negatively correlated with age, family income, family members' support, satisfaction of service objects, and sleep quality (all P<0.01), while positively correlated with education level, fatigue, fear of pneumonia, and the duration of daily attention to the COVID-19 (all P<0.01). SAS was negatively correlated with age, family income, family support, satisfaction of objects service, and sleep quality (all P<0.01), while positively correlated with gender, fatigue, fear of pneumonia, and duration of daily attention to the COVID-19 (all P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS The front-line workers should manage work and rest time reasonably to adjust their negative mood and fatigue. The government and the society should pay more attention to the psychological state of the front-line staff, particularly for the staff working in the community or villages and towns in preventing the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, front-line staff can be obtained mental intervention or be taken a rest from the high-intensive work."

293,10112020112524,"On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization announced the novel coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic due to the rapid growth in the number of cases worldwide. The ability of countries to contain and mitigate interventions is crucial in controlling the exponential spread of the novel virus. Several social distancing and control measurements have been applied in Saudi Arabia to mitigate COVID-19 epidemic such as quarantine, schools closure, suspending travels, reducing crowds, people movement restrictions, self-isolation and contacts tracing. This research aims to study the country interventions in Saudi Arabia and their impact on decreasing the spread of COVID-19. This paper examined different control measurements scenarios produced by a modified SEIR mathematical model with an emphasis on testing capacity expansion and number of critical cases. The modified SEIR mathematical model is solved numerically using Rung-Kutta analysis method for solving the modified SEIR system of ordinary differential equations. The simulation results revealed that the interventions are vital to flatten the virus spread curve. Early implementation of country interventions can delay the peak and decrease the population fatality rate."
294,101420210211940,"First documented in China in early December 2019, the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread rapidly and continues to test the strength of healthcare systems and public health programs all over the world. Underlying cardiovascular disease has been recognized as a risk factor for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related morbidity and mortality since the early days of the pandemic. In addition, evidence demonstrates cardiac and endothelial damage in somewhere between one-third and three-quarters of individuals with COVID-19, regardless of symptom severity. This damage is thought to be mediated by direct viral infection, immunopathology and hypoxemia with the additional possibility of exacerbation via medication-induced cardiotoxicity. Clinically, the cardiovascular consequences of COVID-19 may present as myocarditis with or without arrhythmia, endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis, acute coronary syndromes and heart failure. Presentation can vary widely and may or may not be typical of the condition in an individual without COVID-19. There is evidence to support the prognostic utility of cardiac biomarkers (e.g., cardiac troponin) and imaging studies (e.g., echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging) in the context of COVID-19 and building evidence suggests that cardiovascular screening may be warranted even among those with asymptomatic or mild infection and those without traditional cardiovascular risk factors. In addition, evidence suggests the potential for long-term cardiovascular consequences for those who recover from COVID-19 with implications for the field of cardiology long into the future. Even among those without COVID-19, disruption of infrastructure and changes in human behavior as a result of the pandemic also have an upstream role in cardiovascular outcomes, which have already been documented in multiple locations. This review summarizes what is currently known regarding the pathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19-related cardiovascular injury and describes clinical cardiovascular presentations, prognostic indicators, recommendations for screening and treatment, and long-term cardiovascular consequences of infection. Ultimately, medical personnel must be vigilant in their attention to possible cardiovascular symptoms, take appropriate steps for clinical diagnosis and be prepared for long-term ramifications of myocardial injury sustained as a result of COVID-19."
295,10082020084939,"We present two different approaches for modeling the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Both approaches are based on the population classes susceptible, exposed, infectious, quarantined, and recovered and allow for an arbitrary number of subgroups with different infection rates and different levels of testing. The first model is derived from a set of ordinary differential equations that incorporates the rates at which population transitions take place among classes. The other is a particle model, which is a specific case of crowd simulation model, in which the disease is transmitted through particle collisions and infection rates are varied by adjusting the particle velocities. The parameters of these two models are tuned using information on COVID-19 from the literature and country-specific data, including the effect of restrictions as they were imposed and lifted. We demonstrate the applicability of both models using data from Cyprus, for which we find that both models yield very similar results, giving confidence in the predictions."
296,10042020040296,"Microglial heterogeneity has been the topic of much discussion in the scientific community. Elucidation of their plasticity and adaptability to disease states triggered early efforts to characterize microglial subsets. Over time, their phenotypes, and later on their homeostatic signature, were revealed, through the use of increasingly advanced transcriptomic techniques. Recently, an increasing number of these “microglial signatures” have been reported in various homeostatic and disease contexts. Remarkably, many of these states show similar overlapping microglial gene expression patterns, both in homeostasis and in disease or injury. In this review, we integrate information from these studies, and we propose a unique subset, for which we introduce a core signature, based on our own research and reports from the literature. We describe that this subset is found in development and in normal aging as well as in diverse diseases. We discuss the functions of this subset as well as how it is induced."
297,10102020107696,"With the advent of rapid international travel, disease can now spread between nations faster than ever. As such, when outbreaks occur in foreign states, pressure mounts to reduce the risk of importing cases to the home nation. In a previous paper, we developed a model to investigate the potential effectiveness of deploying screening at airports during outbreaks of influenza, SARS, and Ebola. We also applied the model to the current COVID-19 outbreak. This model simulated the testing of travellers (assumed not to be displaying symptoms prior to boarding their flight) as they arrived at their destination. The model showed that the reduction in risk of case importation that screening alone could deliver was minimal across most scenarios considered, with outputs indicating that screening alone could detect at most 46.4%, 12.9%, and 4.0% of travellers infected with influenza, SARS and Ebola respectively, while the model also reported a detection rate of 12.0% for COVID-19. In this paper, we present a brief modification to this model allowing us to assess the added impact that quarantining incoming travelers for various periods may have on reducing the risk of case importation. Primary results show that requiring all travellers to undergo 5 days of self-isolation on arrival, after which they are tested again, has the potential to increase rates of detection to 100%, 87.6%, 81.7% and 41.3% for travellers infected with influenza, SARS, COVID-19 and Ebola respectively. Extending the period of self-isolation to 14 days increases these potential detection rates to 100%, 100%, 99.5% and 91.8% respectively."
298,100820200811679,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes has been found to be one of the leading comorbidities associated with fatality in COVID-19 patients. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry is facilitated by interaction with Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) and possible polymorphisms in ACE2 can be a determining factor in host-viral protein interaction. A significant shift of healthcare towards ‘Telemedicine’ is also on the rise. In this review, the possible effects of ACE2 polymorphisms on SARS-CoV-2 entry along with the escalation of ‘telemedicine’ is discussed. METHOD: An expansive literature search using keywords: “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “diabetes”, “type 2 diabetes’’, “type 1 diabetes”, “ACE2”, “polymorphism”, “DPP4” and “telemedicine” was conducted on Pubmed and EMBASE till 7(th) August, 2020. RESULT: Possible polymorphisms in ACE2 gene can play a role in influencing the virus entry in host body. Telemedicine can be bring a new revolution for medical sector. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 severity is more heinous among diabetic population. So far, the in-silico studies involving human ACE2-viral Spike (S) interaction showed inconsistent predictions regarding some SNPs. But without actual in-vivo studies, a holistic understanding can’t be established."
299,100620200612196,"The emergence and worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused major disruptions to the healthcare system and medical education. In response, the scientific community has been acquiring, releasing, and publishing data at a remarkable pace. At the same time, medical practitioners are taxed with greater professional duties than ever before, making it challenging to stay current with the influx of medical literature. To address the above mismatch between data release and provider capacity and to support our colleagues, physicians at the Massachusetts General Hospital have engaged in an electronic collaborative effort focused on rapid literature appraisal and dissemination regarding SARS-CoV-2 with a focus on critical care. Members of the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, the Division of Cardiology, and the Department of Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital established the Fast Literature Assessment and Review (FLARE) team. This group rapidly compiles, appraises, and synthesizes literature regarding SARS-CoV-2 as it pertains to critical care, relevant clinical questions, and anecdotal reports. Daily, FLARE produces and disseminates highly curated scientific reviews and opinion pieces, which are distributed to readers using an online newsletter platform. Interest in our work has escalated rapidly. FLARE was quickly shared with colleagues outside our division, and, in a short time, our audience has grown to include more than 4,000 readers across the globe. Creating a collaborative group with a variety of expertise represents a feasible and acceptable way of rapidly appraising, synthesizing, and communicating scientific evidence directly to frontline clinicians in this time of great need."
300,10072020076286,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is threating our health systems and daily lives and is responsible for causing substantial morbidity and mortality. In particular, aged individuals and individuals with comorbidities, including obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, have significantly higher risks of hospitalization and death than normal individuals. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hypertension. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), belonging to the RAS family, has received much attention during this COVID-19 pandemic, owing to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a receptor for cellular entry. Additionally, the RAS greatly affects energy metabolism in certain pathological conditions, including cardiac failure, diabetes mellitus, and viral infections. This article discusses the potential mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 modulates the RAS and energy metabolism in individuals with obesity and diabetes mellitus. The article aims to highlight the appropriate strategies for combating the COVID-19 pandemic in the clinical setting and emphasize on the areas that require further investigation in relation to COVID-19 infections in patients with obesity and diabetes mellitus from the viewpoint of endocrinology and metabolism."
301,10092020097022,"This paper provides early evidence of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on minority unemployment in the United States. In the first month following March adoptions of social distancing measures by states, unemployment rose to 14.5 percent but a much higher 24.4 percent when we correct for potential data misclassification noted by the BLS. Using the official definition, unemployment in April 2020 among African-Americans rose by less than what would have been anticipated (to 16.6 percent) based on previous recessions, and the long-term ordering of unemployment across racial/ethnic groups was altered with Latinx unemployment (18.2 percent) rising for the first time to the highest among major groups. Difference-in-difference estimates confirm that the initial gap in unemployment between whites and blacks in April was not different than in periods prior to the pandemic; however, the racial gap expanded as unemployment for whites declined in the next two months but was largely stagnant for blacks. The initially large gap in unemployment between whites and Latinx in April was sustained in May and June as unemployment declined similarly for both groups. Non-linear decompositions show a favorable industry distribution partly protected black employment during the early stages of the pandemic, but that an unfavorable occupational distribution and lower average skills levels placed them at higher risk of job losses. An unfavorable occupational distribution and lower skills contributed to a sharply widened Latinx-white unemployment gap that moderated over time as rehiring occurred. These findings of disproportionate impacts on minority unemployment raise important concerns regarding lost earnings and wealth, and longer-term consequences of the pandemic on racial inequality in the United States."

Results indicated that the C19P-SE has adequate reliability (α = .93) along with factorial, discriminant, and convergent validity. Results of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported the four-factor structure of the C19P-SE. Concurrent validity results indicate a significant positive correlation between coronaphobia and state anxiety (r = .67, p < .001), suggesting that individuals with higher levels of coronaphobia may also have higher levels of state anxiety or vice versa. Further, we found a multivariate difference in coronaphobia between men and women."
303,101420210210486,"Spaced-learning refers to teaching spread over time, compared to mass-learning where the same duration of teaching is completed in one session. Our hypothesis is that spaced-learning is better than mass-learning in retaining microsurgical suturing skills. Medical students were randomized into mass-learning (single 8-h session) and spaced-learning (2-h weekly sessions over 4 weeks) groups. They were taught to place 9 sutures in a 4 mm-wide elastic strip. The primary outcome was precision of suture placement during a test conducted 1 month after completion of sessions. Secondary outcomes were time taken, cumulative performance, and participant satisfaction. 42 students (24 in the mass-learning group; 18 in spaced-learning group) participated. 3 students in the spaced-learning group were later excluded as they did not complete all sessions. Both groups had comparable baseline suturing skills but at 1 month after completion of teaching, the total score for suture placement were higher in spaced-learning group (27.63 vs 31.60,p = 0.04). There was no statistical difference for duration and satisfaction in either group. Both groups showed an improvement in technical performance over the sessions, but this did not differ between both groups. Microsurgical courses are often conducted in mass-learning format so spaced learning offers an alternative that enhances retention of complex surgical skills."
304,10102020109863,"BACKGROUND: The emerging of the novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China, since the time declared as a public health emergency of international concern, its impact on the lives of people is negatively substantial. Despite the vulnerability of all ages from the pandemic, evidence showed that elder people are at high-risk for adverse outcomes from coronavirus disease-19. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of high-risk age groups to coronavirus disease-19 prevention and control in Korem district, Tigray, Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among high-risk age groups from April 2 to May 9/2020 in Korem district, Tigray, Ethiopia. A total of 422 study participants were selected using a simple random sampling technique. The collected data were entered into Epi-data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 22.0 for analysis. Multivariable analysis was done using linear regression after checking collinearity, and a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: A total of 419 study participants were included in the study with a response rate of 99.3%. Overall, about 37.7%, 43.4%, and 52.5% of participants had poor knowledge, negative attitude, and poor practice towards coronavirus disease-19 prevention and control, respectively. Being elder (≥80) years, with no formal education, and having low-income status were among the significantly associated factors. About 76.1% of the respondents did not use hand-rub-based alcohol or sanitizer, and 88.8% did not use any mask in crowding area. CONCLUSION: Generally, the knowledge about coronavirus disease-19 in elders was roughly appropriate but the preventive practices and attitude towards coronavirus disease-19 were found less and inappropriate. Since no proven medicine is invented yet, so maximizing knowledge, increasing behavioral change, and strengthening preventive practices towards coronavirus disease-19 prevention and control is the appropriate solution."
305,10162021041480,"BACKGROUND Recent studies have reported T cell immunity to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in unexposed donors, possibly due to cross-recognition by T-cells specific for common cold coronaviruses (CCCs). True T-cell cross-reactivity, defined as the recognition by a single TCR of more than one distinct peptide-MHC ligand, has never been shown in the context of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS We used the ViraFEST platform to identify T cell responses cross-reactive for the spike (S) glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 and CCCs at the T cell receptor (TCR) clonotype level in convalescent COVID-19 patients (CCPs) and SARS-CoV-2-unexposed donors. Confirmation of SARS-CoV-2/CCC cross-reactivity and assessments of functional avidity were performed using a TCR cloning and transfection system. RESULTS Memory CD4+ T-cell clonotypes that cross-recognized the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and at least one other CCC were detected in 65% of CCPs and unexposed donors. Several of these TCRs were shared among multiple donors. Cross-reactive T-cells demonstrated significantly impaired SARS-CoV-2-specific proliferation in vitro relative to mono-specific CD4+ T-cells, which was consistent with lower functional avidity of their TCRs for SARS CoV-2 relative to CCC. CONCLUSIONS For the first time, our data confirm the existence of unique memory CD4+ T cell clonotypes cross-recognizing SARS-CoV-2 and CCCs. The lower avidity of cross-reactive TCRs for SARS-CoV-2 may be the result of antigenic imprinting, such that pre-existing CCC-specific memory T cells have reduced expansive capacity upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are needed to determine how these cross-reactive T-cell responses impact clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients."
306,10172021054732,"More than 130,000 peer-reviewed studies have been published within one year after COVID-19 emerged in many countries. This large and rapidly growing field may overwhelm the synthesizing abilities of both researchers and policy-makers. To provide a sinopsis, prevent errors, and detect cognitive gaps that may require interdisciplinary research methods, the literature on COVID-19 is summarized, twice. The overall purpose of this study is to generate a dialogue meant to explain the genesis of and/or find remedies for omissions and contradictions. The first review starts in Biology and ends in Policy. Policy is chosen as a destination because it is the setting where cognitive integration must occur. The second review follows the opposite path: it begins with stated policies on COVID-19 and then their assumptions and disciplinary relationships are identified. The purpose of this interdisciplinary method on methods is to yield a relational and explanatory view of the field -one strategy likely to be incomplete but usable when large bodies of literature need to be rapidly summarized. These reviews identify nine inter-related problems, research needs, or omissions, namely: [1] nation-wide, geo-referenced, epidemiological data collection systems (open to and monitored by the public); [2]metrics meant to detect non-symptomatic cases -e.g., test positivity-; [3]cost-benefit oriented methods, which should demonstrate they detect silent viral spreaders even with limited testing; [4] new personalized tests that inform on biological functions and disease correlates, such as cell-mediated immunity, co-morbidities, and immuno-suppression; [5] factors that influence vaccine effectiveness, [6]economic predictions that consider the long-term consequences likely to follow epidemics that growth exponentially; [7] the errors induced by self-limiting and/or implausible paradigms, such as binary and reductionist approaches; [8] new governance models that emphasize problem-solving skills, social participation, and the use of scientific knowledge; and [9] new educational programs that utilize visual aids and audience-specific communication strategies. The analysis indicates that, to optimally address these problems, disciplinary and social integration is needed. By asking what is/are the potential cause(s) and consequence(s) of each issue, this methodology generates visualizations that reveal possible relationships as well as omissions and contradictions. While inherently limited in scope and likely to become obsolete, these shortcomings are avoided when this 'method on methods' is frequently practiced. Open-ended, inter-/trans-disciplinary perspectives and broad social participation may help researchers and citizens to construct, de-construct, and re-construct COVID-19 related research."

308,10092020091453,"STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional, international survey. OBJECTIVES To identify factors influencing pharmacologic anticoagulation initiation after spine surgery based on the AOSpine Anticoagulation Global Survey. METHODS This survey was distributed to the international membership of AOSpine (n = 3805). A Likert-type scale described grade practice-specific factors on a scale from low (1) to high (5) importance, and patient-specific factors a scale from low (0) to high (3) importance. Analysis was performed to determine which factors were significant in the decision making surrounding the initiation of pharmacologic anticoagulation. RESULTS A total of 316 spine surgeons from 64 countries completed the survey. In terms of practice-specific factors considered to initiate treatment, expert opinion was graded the highest (mean grade ± SD = 3.2 ± 1.3), followed by fellowship training (3.2 ± 1.3). Conversely, previous studies (2.7 ± 1.2) and unspecified guidelines were considered least important (2.6 ± 1.6). Patient body mass index (2.0 ± 1.0) and postoperative mobilization (2.3 ± 1.0) were deemed most important and graded highly overall. Those who rated estimated blood loss with greater importance in anticoagulation initiation decision making were more likely to administer thromboprophylaxis at later times (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.68-0.71), while those who rated drain output with greater importance were likely to administer thromboprophylaxis at earlier times (HR = 1.32-1.43). CONCLUSION Among our global cohort of spine surgeons, certain patient factors (ie, patient mobilization and body mass index) and practice-specific factors (ie, expert opinion and fellowship training) were considered to be most important when considering anticoagulation start times."
309,101420210211798,"The unanticipated transition from traditional/on‐campus to distance learning has not only posed challenges in different contexts at the global level, but it also caused disparity in terms of access to education. As a mandate, Goal 4 of Sustainable Development Goals states that by 2030 all member states should work to “ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all” (UNESCO, 2015). In practice, however, the responses of different international education institutions during the Covid‐19 confinement indicate that the achievement of this equity plan at the global level is rather unfeasible. To address this issue from a local lens, this study seeks to examine the plan implemented for online teaching in the Algerian higher education institutions. It draws on a key body of literature on online infrastructure and pedagogy to explore (1) the different online teaching models that were implemented, (2) Algerian higher education teachers' practices within the framework of this new model of teaching, and (3) the different challenges encountered by teachers during this transition. To achieve this end, a qualitative study that is based on an analysis of teachers' interviews is conducted to explore teachers' practices in different higher education institutions in Algeria. The results of this research will not only highlight the prevailing disparities, but will also serve to offer recommendations that could be relevant to future teachers' professional development programs."
310,101620210410724,"Background: The gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis relies on quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain reaction (RT-qPCR) from nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens, but NPSs present several limitations. The simplicity, low invasive and possibility of self-collection of saliva imposed these specimens as a relevant alternative for SARS-CoV-2 detection. However, the discrepancy of saliva test results compared to NPSs made of its use controversial. Here, we assessed Salivettes®, as a standardized saliva collection device, and compared SARS-CoV-2 positivity on paired NPS and saliva specimens. Methods: A total of 303 individuals randomly selected among those investigated for SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled, including 30 (9.9%) patients previously positively tested using NPS (follow-up group), 90 (29.7%) mildly symptomatic and 183 (60.4%) asymptomatic. Results: The RT-qPCR revealed a positive rate of 11.6% (n = 35) and 17.2% (n = 52) for NPSs and saliva samples, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of saliva samples were 82.9% and 91.4%, respectively, using NPS as reference. The highest proportion of discordant results concerned the follow-up group (33.3%). Although the agreement exceeded 90.0% in the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups, 17 individuals were detected positive only in saliva samples, with consistent medical arguments. Conclusion Saliva collected with Salivette® was more sensitive for detecting symptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections."
311,101020201011996,"Background COVID-19, as a newly-emerged viral infection has now spread all over the world after originating in Wuhan, China. Pneumonia is the hallmark of the disease, with dyspnea in half of the patients and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in up to one –third of the cases. Pulmonary edema, neutrophilic infiltration, and inflammatory cytokine release are the pathologic signs of this disease. The anti-inflammatory effect of the photobiomodulation (PBM) has been confirmed in many previous studies. Therefore, this review study was conducted to evaluate the direct effect of PBM on the acute lung inflammation or ARDS and also accelerating the regeneration of the damaged tissues. The indirect effects of PBM on modulation of the immune system, increasing the blood flow and oxygenation in other tissues were also considered. Methodology The databases of PubMed, Cochrane library, and Google Scholar were searched to find the relevant studies. Keywords included the PBM and related terms, lung inflammation, and COVID-19 -related signs. Studies were categorized with respect to the target tissue, laser parameters, and their results. Results Seventeen related papers were included in this review. All of them were in animal models. They showed that the PBM could significantly decrease the pulmonary edema, neutrophil influx, and generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM), reactive oxygen species (ROS), isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2)). Conclusion Our findings revealed that the PBM could be helpful in reducing the lung inflammation and promoting the regeneration of the damaged tissue. PBM can increase the oxygenation indirectly in order to rehabilitate the affected organs. Thus, the infra-red lasers or light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are recommended in this regard."

We aimed to evaluate the association between household crowding and COVID-19 incidence. METHODS: Linear and Poisson regression analyses were used to assess the associations between indices of household crowding (high, average, low) and COVID-19 incidence estimates. RESULTS: Cities with a high index of household crowding were linked with a significantly higher COVID-19 incidence estimate (excess of 461 per 100,000; 95% confidence interval: 371-558 per 100,000). CONCLUSIONS: Crowding typically promotes virus transmission. Considering urban and housing structures is essential in designing mitigation strategies during a pandemic."

314,10122020122145,"BACKGROUND N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation requires the binding of a co-agonist on the glycine-binding site. D-serine is the main endogeneous co-agonist of NMDA receptors, and its availability significantly depends on the activity of the metabolic enzyme D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO). Inhibition of DAAO increases the brain levels of D-serine, and modulates a variety of physiological functions including cognitive behavior. METHODS Here, we examined the effects of a novel 4‑hydroxypyridazin-3(2H)‑one derivative DAAO inhibitor, Compound 30 (CPD30) on passive avoidance learning and on neuronal firing activity in rats. RESULTS D-serine administration was applied as reference, which increased cognitive performance and enhanced hippocampal firing activity and responsiveness to NMDA after both local and systemic application. Similarly to D-serine, CPD30 (0.1 mg/kg) effectively reversed MK-801 induced memory impairment in the passive avoidance test. Furthermore, local iontophoretic application of CPD30 in the vicinity of hippocampal pyramidal neurons significantly increased firing rate, and enhanced their responses to locally applied NMDA. Compound 30 also enhanced hippocampal firing activity after systemic administration. In 0.1-1.0 mg/kg doses, CPD30 increased spontaneous and NMDA-evoked firing activity of the neurons. Effects of CPD30 on NMDA-responsiveness emerged faster (at 10 min post-injection) when 1.0 mg/kg dose was applied compared to the onset of the effects of 0.1 mg/kg CPD30 (at 30 min post-injection). CONCLUSIONS The present results confirm that the inhibition of DAAO enzyme is an effective strategy for cognitive enhancement. Our findings further facilitate the understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying the behavioral effects of DAAO inhibition in the mammalian brain."
315,10112020114155,"The sudden change of moving the majority of teaching online at Universities due to the global Covid-19 pandemic has caused an increased amount of workload for academics. One of the contributing factors is answering a high volume of queries coming from students. As these queries are not limited to the synchronous time frame of a lecture, there is a high chance of many of them being related or even equivalent. One way to deal with this problem is to cluster these questions depending on their topic. In our previous work, we aimed to find an improved method of clustering that would give us a high efficiency, using a recurring LDA model. Our data set contained questions posted online from a Computer Science course at the University of Bath. A significant number of these questions contained code excerpts, which we found caused a problem in clustering, as certain terms were being considered as common words in the English language and not being recognised as specific code terms. To address this, we implemented tagging of these technical terms using Python, as part of preprocessing the data set. In this paper, we explore the realms of tagging data sets, focusing on identifying code excerpts and providing empirical results in order to justify our reasoning."
316,10052020053555,"The rapid rise of social media in the past decade represents a new space where animals are represented in human society, and this may influence human perceptions, for example driving desire for exotic pet keeping. In this study, 211 participants (49% female) between the ages of 18 to 44 were recruited to an online survey where they viewed mock-up pages from a social media site. All participants saw the same image of a primate but were randomly assigned to a pro exotic pet keeping or anti exotic pet keeping narrative condition. When participants were presented with the anti narrative they perceived the animal to be more stressed (χ2 = 13.99, p < 0.001). In free text comments, participants expressed reservations in the face of a narrative they disagreed with in free text comments. Overall, this study found evidence to suggest that people moderate their discussions on human-animal interactions based on the social network they are in, but these relationships are complex and require further research."

318,10172021052343,"Background: High compliance to infection prevention and control (IPC) is vital to prevent health care-associated infections. In the worst 2014–2015 Ebola-affected district in Sierra Leone (Kenema), we assessed (a) average yearly IPC compliance (2016–2018) using a National IPC assessment tool in the district hospital and peripheral health units (PHUs), and (b) gaps in IPC activities, infrastructure and consumables in 2018. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study using secondary program data. Results: At the district hospital, compliance increased from 69% in 2016 to 73% in 2018 (expected minimal threshold = 70%; desired threshold ≥ 85%). Compliance for screening/isolation facilities and decontamination of medical equipment reached 100% in 2018. The two thematic areas with the lowest compliance were sanitation (44%) and sharps safety (56%). In PHUs (2018), the minimal 70% compliance threshold was not achieved in two (of 10 thematic areas) for Community Health Centers, four for Community Health Posts, and five for Maternal and Child Health Units. The lowest compliance was for screening and isolation facilities (range: 33–53%). Conclusion: This baseline assessment is an eye opener of what is working and what is not, and can be used to galvanize political, financial, and material resources to bridge the existing gaps."
319,100920200911251,"INTRODUCTION: In clinical trial for the Ebola virus, the broad-spectrum anti-viral agent remdesivir was shown to have a good safety profile. Remdesivir is now being tested in severe COVID-19. AREAS COVERED: The Gilead Sciences SIMPLE trial suggests that the short-term use of remdesivir probably does not increase mortality dramatically or have serious short-term toxicity when used to treat severe COVID-19. The Adaptive COVID-19 treatment trials (ACTT1) trial showed that remdesivir may shorten recovery and decrease mortality in severe COVID-19 without increasing adverse effects. EXPERT OPINION: It seems to me that we have learnt very little from the SIMPLE trial, and this would be predicted from a trial that has no control or placebo group. The results of ACTT1 were reported early after an interim analysis showed that a higher than expected number of recoveries had occurred. There was an indication that remdesivir may be reducing mortality, but this was no statistical significance. The trial is continuing, and the final data are eagerly awaited to determine whether remdesivir is a game-changing remedy or a ripple in the ongoing search for a medicine for the treatment of COVID-19."
320,10152021038387,"For endemic pathogens, seroprevalence mimics overall exposure and is minimally influenced by the time that recent infections take to seroconvert. Simulating spatially-explicit and stochastic outbreaks, we set out to explore how, for emerging pathogens, the mix of exponential growth in infection events and a constant rate for seroconversion events could lead to real-time significant differences in the total numbers of exposed versus seropositive. We find that real-time seroprevalence of an emerging pathogen can underestimate exposure depending on measurement time, epidemic doubling time, duration and natural variation in the time to seroconversion among hosts. We formalise mathematically how underestimation increases non-linearly as the host’s time to seroconversion is ever longer than the pathogen’s doubling time, and how more variable time to seroconversion among hosts results in lower underestimation. In practice, assuming that real-time seroprevalence reflects the true exposure to emerging pathogens risks overestimating measures of public health importance (e.g. infection fatality ratio) as well as the epidemic size of future waves. These results contribute to a better understanding and interpretation of real-time serological data collected during the emergence of pathogens in infection-naive host populations."
321,101120201111366,"BACKGROUND: One of the strictest quarantines worldwide to limit the spread of coronavirus was enforced in Jordan during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated reported mental health and changes in lifestyle practices among Jordanian mothers during COVID-19 quarantine. The specific objectives included studying the level of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms and their potential statistical associations with demographic and lifestyle variables. Furthermore, the study aimed to investigate differences in mental health between different demographic and socio-economic groups and to examine the major lifestyle changes that occurred on mothers during the quarantine. METHODS: An online survey was developed and administered to 2103 mothers. Participants were asked to complete a sociodemographic data form, Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and a lifestyle section comparing the life of mothers before and during the quarantine. Reported scores of depression, anxiety, and stress were calculated and compared across different levels of demographics including income, education level, employment status, and city of residence. RESULTS: This study found that mothers with lower income, lower education, not employed, or living in cities outside the capital of Jordan reported having more depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms (p < .005). Changes in their lifestyle practices included weight gain, increased time allocated for teaching children at home, increased familial violence at home, and increased time allocated for caring for their family members (average increase of 5 hours daily). CONCLUSIONS FOR PRACTICE: The unprecedented times of quarantine have put mothers in unprecedented reported mental health problems. Providing psychological support to this group might be a priority."

323,10062020064883,"PURPOSE: Microscale droplets act as coronaviruses (CoV) carriers in the air when released from an infected person and may infect others during close contact such as ophthalmic examination. The main objective of the present work is to demonstrate how CoV deposited droplets are projected during biomicroscopy and to discuss what kind of precautions should be taken in ophthalmic practice. METHODS: A coupled fluid-structure system comprising smoothed particle hydrodynamics and the finite element method has been built to assess the projection of droplets spreading from an infected person. Different conditions based on the maximum exit flow velocity from the infector’s mouth during the ophthalmic examination were modeled. RESULTS: During exhalation, for which the exit flow is ~ 1000 mm/s, the average horizontal distance of the flow front was ~ 200 mm while individual particles can reach up to ~ 500 mm. In case of coughing or sneezing (corresponding to an exit flow of ~ 12,000 mm/s), the average horizontal distance of the flow front was ~ 1300 mm. CONCLUSION: During the ophthalmic examination, the proximity to the patient’s nose and mouth was observed to be less than the horizontal distance of flow front particles. Even though mounted breath shields are used, particles flew beyond the shield and contaminate the ophthalmologist. Compared with the current protective breath shields, the use of a larger shield with a minimum radius of 18 cm is needed to decrease viral transmission.

From the reported cases in the literatures, the level of D-dimer in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is positively correlated with the severity of illness, which needs the attention of clinical workers. According to Western medicine, the increase of D-dimer is related to the hyperactivity of fibrinolytic system and the shortening of prothrombin time (PT), resulting in excessive production and degradation of plasma fibrin and hypercoagulable state of blood, while traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) believes that the above syndromes belong to the pathogenesis of ""blood stasis"" according to TCM theories. Over the years, TCM has a significant effect on promoting blood circulation, removing blood stasis and improving microcirculation.

327,101020201010450,"INTRODUCTION: Medical culture can make trainees feel like there is neither room for mistakes, nor space for personal shortcomings in the makeup of physicians. A dearth of role models who can exemplify that it is acceptable to need support compounds barriers to help-seeking once students struggle. We conducted a mixed-methods study to assess the impact of physicians sharing their living experiences with medical students. METHODS: Second-year medical students participated, through synchronized videoconferencing, in an intervention consisting of 3 physicians who shared personal histories of vulnerability (e.g. failure on high-stakes exams; immigration and acculturation stress; and personal psychopathology, including treatment and recovery), followed by facilitated, small-group discussions. For the quantitative component, students completed the Opening Minds to Stigma Scale for Health Care Providers (OMS-HC) before and after the intervention. For the qualitative component, we conducted focus groups to explore the study intervention. We analyzed anonymized transcripts using thematic analysis aided by NVivo software. RESULTS: We invited all students in the class (n = 61, 46% women) to participate in the research component. Among the 53 participants (87% of the class), OMS-HC scores improved after the intervention (P = .002), driven by the Attitudes (P = .003) and Disclosure (P < .001) subscales. We conducted 4 focus groups, each with a median of 6 participants (range, 5-7). We identified, through iterative thematic analysis of focus group transcripts, active components before, during, and after the intervention, with unexpected vulnerability and unarmored mutuality as particularly salient. CONCLUSIONS: Sharing histories of personal vulnerability by senior physicians can lessen stigmatized views of mental health and normalize help-seeking among medical students. Synchronous videoconferencing proved to be an effective delivery mechanism for the intervention in a ‘virtual wellness’ format. Candid sharing by physicians has the potential to enhance students’ ability to recognize, address, and seek help for their own mental health needs."
328,100820200810567,"A novel concept in DNA vaccine design is the creation of an inhaled DNA plasmid construct containing a portion of the coronavirus spike protein for treatment and vaccination. The secretion of a spike protein portion will function as a competitive antagonist by interfering with the binding of coronavirus to the angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. The secreted protein binding to the ACE2 receptor provides a unique mechanism of action for treatment to all strains of coronavirus in naïve patients, by blocking the ACE2 receptor site. An inhaled plasmid DNA vaccine replicates the route of lung infection taken by coronavirus with transfected cells secreting spike protein portions to induce immunity. Unlike most DNA vaccines with intracellular antigen presentation through MHC I, the current vaccine relies on the secreted proteins presentation through MHC II as well as MHC I to induce immunity. Lung specific production of vaccine particles by inhaled plasmid DNA is appealing since it may have limited systemic side‐effects, and may induce both humoral and cytotoxic immunity. Finally, the ease and ability to rapidly produce this plasmid construct makes this an ideal solution for managing the emerging threat of coronavirus."
329,10102020106588,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, prioritization of care and utilization of scarce resources are daily considerations in healthcare systems that have never experienced these issues before. Elective surgical cases have been largely postponed, and surgery departments are struggling to correctly and equitably determine which cases need to proceed. A resource to objectively prioritize and track time sensitive cases would be useful as an adjunct to clinical decision-making. METHODS: A multidisciplinary working group at Emory Healthcare developed and implemented an adjudication tool for the prioritization of time sensitive surgeries. The variables identified by the team to form the construct focused on the patient’s survivability according to actuarial data, potential impact on function with delay in care, and high-level biology of disease. Implementation of the prioritization was accomplished with a database design to streamline needed communication between surgeons and surgical adjudicators. All patients who underwent time sensitive surgery between 4/10/20 and 6/15/20 across 5 campuses were included. RESULTS: The primary outcomes of interest were calculated patient prioritization score and number of days until operation. 1767 cases were adjudicated during the specified time period. The distribution of prioritization scores was normal, such that real-time adjustment of the empiric algorithm was not required. On retrospective review, as the patient prioritization score increased, the number of days to the operating room decreased. This confirmed the functionality of the tool and provided a framework for organization across multiple campuses. CONCLUSIONS: We developed an in-house adjudication tool to aid in the prioritization of a large cohort of canceled and time sensitive surgeries. The tool is relatively simple in its design, reproducible, and data driven which allows for an objective adjunct to clinical decision-making. The database design was instrumental in communication optimization during this chaotic period for patients and surgeons."
330,10042020041188,"INTRODUCTION Anosmia has not been formally recognised as a symptom of COVID-19 infection. Growing anecdotal evidence suggests increasing incidence of cases of anosmia during the current pandemic, suggesting that COVID-19 may cause olfactory dysfunction. The objective was to characterise patients reporting new onset anosmia during the COVID-19 pandemic METHODOLOGY: Design: Survey of 2428 patients reporting new onset anosmia during the COVID-19 pandemic. SETTING Volunteer sample of patients seeking medical advice of recent onset self-diagnosed loss of sense of smell RESULTS: 2428 surveys were completed within 7 days; 64% respondents were under 40. The majority of respondents reported onset of their anosmia in the last week. Of the cohort, 17% did not report any other symptom thought to be associated with COVID-19. In patients who reported other symptoms, 51% reported either cough or fever and therefore met current guidelines for self-isolation. CONCLUSIONS Anosmia is reported in conjunction with well-reported symptoms of coronas virus, but 1 in 6 patients with recent onset anosmia report this as an isolated symptom. This might help identify otherwise asymptomatic carriers of disease and trigger targeted testing. Further study with COVID-19 testing is required to identify the proportion of patients in whom new onset anosmia can be attributed to COVID-19."
331,10052020058400,"ABSTRACT Background The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically reduced adult cardiac surgery case volumes as institutions and surgeons curtail non-urgent operations. There will be a progressive increase in deferred cases during the pandemic that will require completion within a limited time frame once restrictions ease. We investigated the impact of various levels of increased post-pandemic hospital operating capacity on the time to clear the backlog of deferred cases. Methods We collected data from four cardiac surgery programs across two health systems. We recorded case rates at baseline and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We created a mathematical model to quantify the cumulative surgical backlog based on the projected pandemic duration. We then used our model to predict the time required to clear the backlog depending on the level of increased operating capacity. Results Cardiac surgery volumes fell to 54% of baseline after restrictions were implemented. Assuming a service restoration date of either June 1 or July 1, we calculated the need to perform 216% or 263% of monthly baseline volume, respectively, to clear the backlog in one month. The actual duration required to clear the backlog is highly dependent on hospital capacity in the post-COVID time period, and ranges from one to eight months depending on when services are restored and degree of increased capacity. Conclusions Cardiac surgical operating capacity during the COVID-19 recovery period will have a dramatic impact on the time to clear the deferred cases backlog. Inadequate operating capacity may cause substantial delays and increase morbidity and mortality. If only pre-pandemic capacity is available, the backlog will never clear."

We did a cross-sectional study to assess the impact of this outbreak on children with cancer concerning all aspects of life including medical services provided, the specific precautions to prevent spread in cancer patients, mental, psychological effects, and its effect on the quality of life. We collected 204 responses during a survey that assessed the impact on the treatment of cancer children at a tertiary institution during the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of patients were receiving ongoing chemotherapy for leukemia/lymphoma. The majority of these patients (60.5%) reported a delay in treatment received due to hospital cancellation of appointments due to the pandemic. Although the majority of patients in our cohort complained of delayed treatment, fortunately, none of the delays led to fatalities. In the context of global lockdowns and physical distancing to help flatten the COVID-19 curve, telemedicine has proved fundamental to keeping patients and their healthcare providers connected and safe. Children also faced multiple other difficulties such as psychosocial issues during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our long-term goals are to develop new programs that will enable children with cancer to emerge successfully during a pandemic."
333,10042020042481,"Fake news that manipulates political elections, strikes financial systems and even incites riots is more viral than real news online, resulting in unstable societies and buffeted democracy. The easier contagion of fake news online can be causally explained by the greater anger it carries. Offline questionnaires reveal that anger leads to more incentivized audiences in terms of anxiety management and information sharing and accordingly makes fake news more contagious than real news online. Our results suggest that the digital contagion of emotions, in particular anger, should be comprehensively considered in profiling the spread of online information. Cures such as tagging anger in social media could be implemented to slow or prevent the contagion of fake news at the source."
334,10102020105081,"There is a debate in Argentina about the effectiveness of mandatory lockdown measures in containing COVID-19 that lasts five months making it one of the longest in the World. The population effort to comply the lockdown has been decreasing over time given the economic and social costs that it entails. We contributes by analyzing the Argentinian case through information of mobility and contagion given answers to recurrent questions on these topics. This paper aims to fill the gap in the literature by assessing the effects of lockdown measures and the regional relaxation on the numbers of rate of new infections. We also respond to issues of internal political discussion on regional contagion and the effect of marches and unexpected crowd events.We use pool, fixed and random effects panel data modeling and Granger causality tests identifying relations between mobility and contagion. Our results show that lockdown in Argentina has been effective in reducing the mobility but not in way that reduces the rate of contagion. Strict lockdown seems to be effective in short periods of time and by extend it without complementary measures loss effectiveness. Contagion rate seems to be discretely displaced in time and resurging amidst slowly increasing in mobility."
335,100620200610781,"New cases of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continue to rise worldwide following the declaration of a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The current pandemic has completely altered the workflow of health services worldwide. However, even during this critical period, patients with other diseases, like cancer, need to be properly treated. A few reports have shown that mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 is higher in elderly patients and those with other active comorbidities, including cancer. Patients with lung cancer are at risk of pulmonary complications from COVID-19, and as such, the risk/benefit ratio of local and systemic anticancer treatment has to be considered. For each patient, several factors, including age, comorbidities, and immunosuppression, as well as the number of hospital visits for treatment, can influence this risk. The number of cases is rising exponentially in Brazil, and it is important to consider the local characteristics when approaching the pandemic. In this regard, the Brazilian Thoracic Oncology Group has developed recommendations to guide decisions in lung cancer treatment during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Due to the scarcity of relevant data, discussions based on disease stage, evaluation of surgical treatment, radiotherapy techniques, systemic therapy, follow-up, and supportive care were carried out, and specific suggestions issued. All recommendations seek to reduce contagion risk by decreasing the number of medical visits and hospitalization, and in the case of immunosuppression, by adapting treatment schemes when possible. This statement should be adjusted according to the reality of each service, and can be revised as new data become available."

338,10092020095635,"Simulation models are valuable tools for resource usage estimation and capacity planning. In many situations, reliable data is not available. We introduce the BuB simulator, which requires only the specification of plausible intervals for the simulation parameters. By performing a surrogate-model based optimization, improved simulation model parameters can be determined. Furthermore, a detailed statistical analysis can be performed, which allows deep insights into the most important model parameters and their interactions. This information can be used to screen the parameters that should be further investigated. To exemplify our approach, a capacity and resource planning task for a hospital was simulated and optimized. The study explicitly covers difficulties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It can be shown, that even if only limited real-world data is available, the BuB simulator can be beneficially used to consider worst- and best-case scenarios. The BuB simulator can be extended in many ways, e.g., by adding further resources (personal protection equipment, staff, pharmaceuticals) or by specifying several cohorts (based on age, health status, etc.).

339,101520210312861,"The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly altered existing health care operations, including dentistry. The fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the need for increased protection measures have led to a reduction in the number of appointments and the range of performed procedures. Our study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (the pre-vaccine period) on the spectrum of performed dental services, with particular emphasis on the change in the proportion of conservative and surgical procedures. The patient base in the University Center of Dentistry and Specialized Medicine (Poznan, Poland) from two periods—pre-pandemic (1 February 2019–31 January 2020) and pandemic (1 February 2020–31 January 2021)—was analyzed. The number of dental services was standardized against the sum of all procedures in a given month. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of conservative procedures such as commercial restorations or filled canals has significantly decreased, while the number of surgical procedures has increased. The pandemic has undoubtedly affected the spectrum of dental procedures performed, especially in its acute phase. It is very important to return to performing conservative procedures and educating students in the former range while respecting all safety standards."

However, they can be used under a specific condition only. That is, only when the user knows where the object of interest is. In this paper, we first point out the fact mentioned above by categorizing the tasks that obtain visual information using computer vision techniques. Then, in looking for something as a representative task in a category, we argue suitable camera systems and rotation navigation methods. In the latter, we propose novel voice navigation methods. As a result of a user study comprised of seven people with visual impairment, we found that (1) a camera with a wide field of view such as an omnidirectional camera was preferred, and (2) users have different preferences in navigation methods."

In doing so, we considered quantitative, qualitative, and geographic information systems (GIS) datasets to identify the location of existing COVID-19 testing centers. Moreover, we attempted to collect data from the existing centers in order to demonstrate testing times at the divisional level of the country. Results show that the number of testing centers is not enough to cater to the vast population of the country. Additionally, we found that the number of days it takes to receive the results from the COVID-19 testing centers is not optimal at divisional cities, let alone the remote rural areas. Finally, we propose a set of recommendations in order to enhance the existing system to assist more people under a testing range of COVID-19 viruses at the local level."

345,10112020110333,"This chapter draws out seven lessons from the cross-country analysis of the six reforms studied in this chapter. These are: Lesson 1. The power of complex mindsets about education reform. The six reforms all reflect reliance on the worldviews presented in the five frames of reform: cultural, psychological, professional, institutional and political. Those that have been sustained relied on insights from more of these five frames than those that were short lived. Lesson 2. Implementation matters considerably. The chapter discusses how the implementation process in effect recreates a reform, and how the development of an operational strategy defining the details of reform is what in the end most matters to the success of reform. The chapter discusses how the six reforms produced rather distinct operational strategies of seemingly similar components of the reform such as the learning goals for students or teacher professional development. Implementation strategies are also based on implicit theories of how organizations work, and the chapter explains the usefulness of a developmental theory of how organizations evolve to designing strategies that are aligned with the functionings that are possible in a given developmental stage, while also helping the organization evolve towards higher levels of functioning. Lesson 3. The need for operational clarity. People can’t execute what they don’t understand, and a reform must be able to translate goals into clear objectives and reform components into clear tasks which can be widely communicated and understood, as well as tracked to discern improvement and course correct when necessary. Lesson 4. Large scale reform is a journey: Coherence, Completeness and the Five Frames. The chapter explains how using the five dimensional theory of educational change can support coherence and completeness in a reform. Lesson 5. Sequencing, pacing and the importance of first steps. An operational strategy needs to be sequenced attending to ambition of goals, to existing levels of capacity and to institutional stage of development of the system. The first steps in the sequence are consequential because they shape the narrative of reform in ways that have long lasting consequences. Lesson 6. Staying the course. Long policy cycles are essential for reforms to be implemented and to produce results, and those cannot be taken for granted. Coherence, communication and participation can garner support that sustains a reform over time. Lesson 7. Learning from experience to build system level capacity. Most important to the coherent implementation of a reform is to create opportunities for key stakeholders, at various levels of the system, to learn together as a result of implementing components of the reform. Creating feedback loops and processes for making sense of such information is critical to support such learning."
346,10172021056125,"Patients with chronic inflammatory diseases are often treated with immunosuppressants and therefore are of particular concern during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Serological tests will improve our understanding of the infection and immunity in this population, unless they tests give false positive results. The aim of this study was to evaluate the specificity of SARS-Cov-2 serological assays using samples from patients with chronic inflammatory diseases collected prior to April 2019, thus defined as negative. Samples from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS, n=10), rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n=47) with or without rheumatoid factor (RF) and/or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP2) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, n=10) with or without RF, were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using 17 commercially available lateral flow assays (LFA), two ELISA kits and one in-house developed IgG multiplex bead-based assay. Six LFA and the in-house validated IgG assay correctly produced negative results for all samples. However, the majority of assays (n=13), gave false positive signal for samples from patients with RA and SLE. This was most notable in samples from RF positive RA patients. No false positive samples were detected in any assay using samples from patients with MS. Poor specificity of commercial serological assays could possibly be, at least partly, due to interfering antibodies in samples from patients with chronic inflammatory diseases. For these patients, the risk of false positivity should be considered when interpreting results of the SARS-CoV-2 serological assays."

348,10142021026160,"The way that people with an intellectual disability are supported is very important. The COVID‐19 virus has changed the way that staff help people with an intellectual disability. We wanted to know about those changes and whether learning about positive behavioural support (PBS) helped staff to cope with them. The main changes were that people with an intellectual disability could not go out or see family and friends as often. Staff came up with new things to do for the people they supported, and PBS learning seemed to help staff to cope. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that COVID‐19 and the associated restrictions are likely to have a negative impact on the provision of positive behavioural support (PBS) to people with an intellectual disability. METHODS: Fifty‐eight staff, who had recently completed an accredited positive behavioural support (PBS) programme, responded to an online questionnaire, which asked them to rate the impact of COVID‐19 on factors related to PBS. RESULTS: Participants reported a neutral or somewhat positive impact on all the areas measured, with the exception of the activities and quality of life of those they supported, which were somewhat negatively affected. The participants rated the learning from their PBS programme as helping them cope with COVID‐19 to some extent. Examples of positive and negative effects and ways in which PBS helped staff to cope are presented. CONCLUSIONS: Many staff developed creative solutions that allowed them to provide PBS despite the COVID‐19 restrictions. PBS learning appeared to help staff cope with the negative impact of the restrictions."

METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial of the Ad5-vectored COVID-19 vaccine was done in a single centre in Wuhan, China. Healthy adults aged 18 years or older, who were HIV-negative and previous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection-free, were eligible to participate and were randomly assigned to receive the vaccine at a dose of 1 × 10(11) viral particles per mL or 5 × 10(10) viral particles per mL, or placebo. Investigators allocated participants at a ratio of 2:1:1 to receive a single injection intramuscularly in the arm. The randomisation list (block size 4) was generated by an independent statistician. Participants, investigators, and staff undertaking laboratory analyses were masked to group allocation. The primary endpoints for immunogenicity were the geometric mean titres (GMTs) of specific ELISA antibody responses to the receptor binding domain (RBD) and neutralising antibody responses at day 28. The primary endpoint for safety evaluation was the incidence of adverse reactions within 14 days. All recruited participants who received at least one dose were included in the primary and safety analyses. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04341389. FINDINGS: 603 volunteers were recruited and screened for eligibility between April 11 and 16, 2020. 508 eligible participants (50% male; mean age 39·7 years, SD 12·5) consented to participate in the trial and were randomly assigned to receive the vaccine (1 × 10(11) viral particles n=253; 5 × 10(10) viral particles n=129) or placebo (n=126). In the 1 × 10(11) and 5 × 10(10) viral particles dose groups, the RBD-specific ELISA antibodies peaked at 656·5 (95% CI 575·2–749·2) and 571·0 (467·6–697·3), with seroconversion rates at 96% (95% CI 93–98) and 97% (92–99), respectively, at day 28. Both doses of the vaccine induced significant neutralising antibody responses to live SARS-CoV-2, with GMTs of 19·5 (95% CI 16·8–22·7) and 18·3 (14·4–23·3) in participants receiving 1 × 10(11) and 5 × 10(10) viral particles, respectively. Specific interferon γ enzyme-linked immunospot assay responses post vaccination were observed in 227 (90%, 95% CI 85–93) of 253 and 113 (88%, 81–92) of 129 participants in the 1 × 10(11) and 5 × 10(10) viral particles dose groups, respectively. Solicited adverse reactions were reported by 183 (72%) of 253 and 96 (74%) of 129 participants in the 1 × 10(11) and 5 × 10(10) viral particles dose groups, respectively. Severe adverse reactions were reported by 24 (9%) participants in the 1 × 10(11) viral particles dose group and one (1%) participant in the 5 × 10(10) viral particles dose group. No serious adverse reactions were documented. INTERPRETATION: The Ad5-vectored COVID-19 vaccine at 5 × 10(10) viral particles is safe, and induced significant immune responses in the majority of recipients after a single immunisation.

350,10142021029253,"BACKGROUND: Pneumonitis belongs to the fatal toxicities of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Its diagnosis is based on immunotherapeutic histories, clinical symptoms, and the computed tomography (CT) imaging. The radiological features were typically ground-glass opacities, similar to CT presentation of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia. Thus, clinicians are cautious in differential diagnosis especially in COVID-19 epidemic areas. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein, we report a 67-year-old Han Chinese male patient presenting with dyspnea and normal body temperature on the 15th day of close contact with his son, who returned from Wuhan. He was diagnosed as advanced non-small cell lung cancer and developed pneumonitis post Sintilimab injection during COIVD-19 pandemic period. The chest CT indicated peripherally subpleural lattice opacities at the inferior right lung lobe and bilateral thoracic effusion. The swab samples were taken twice within 72 hours and real-time reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) results were COVID-19 negative. The patient was thereafter treated with prednisolone and antibiotics for over 2 weeks. The suspicious lesion has almost absorbed according to CT imaging, consistent with prominently falling CRP level. The anti-PD-1 related pneumonitis mixed with bacterial infection was clinically diagnosed based on the laboratory and radiological evidences and good response to the prednisolone and antibiotics. CONCLUSION: The anti-PD-1 related pneumonitis and COVID-19 pneumonia possess similar clinical presentations and CT imaging features. Therefore, differential diagnosis depends on the epidemiological and immunotherapy histories, RT-PCR tests. The response to glucocorticoid is still controversial but helpful for the diagnosis."
351,10132021010213,"The perception of the impact of climate change on the environment is becoming a lived experience for more and more people. Several new terms for climate change-induced distress have been introduced to describe the long-term emotional consequences of anticipated or actual environmental changes, with ecological grief as a prime example. The mourning of the loss of ecosystems, landscapes, species and ways of life is likely to become a more frequent experience around the world. However, there is a lack of conceptual clarity and systematic research efforts with regard to such ecological grief. This perspective article introduces the concept of ecological grief and contextualizes it within the field of bereavement. We provide a case description of a mountaineer in Central Europe dealing with ecological grief. We introduce ways by which ecological grief may pose a mental health risk and/or motivate environmental behavior and delineate aspects by which it can be differentiated from related concepts of solastalgia and eco-anxiety. In conclusion, we offer a systematic agenda for future research that is embedded in the context of disaster mental health and bereavement research."
352,101420210212291,"BACKGROUND: : Qingfei Paidu Tang (QPT), a formula of traditional Chinese medicine, which was suggested to be able to ease symptoms in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been recommended by clinical guidelines and widely used to treat COVID-19 in China. However, whether it decreases mortality remains unknown. PURPOSE: : We aimed to explore the association between QPT use and in-hospital mortality among patients hospitalized for COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: : A retrospective study based on a real-world database was conducted. METHODS: : We identified patients consecutively hospitalized with COVID-19 in 15 hospitals from a national retrospective registry in China, from January through May 2020. Data on patients’ characteristics, treatments, and outcomes were extracted from the electronic medical records. The association of QPT use with COVID-19 related mortality was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models based on propensity score analysis. RESULTS: : Of the 8939 patients included, 28.7% received QPT. The COVID-19 related mortality was 1.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8% to 1.7%) among the patients receiving QPT and 4.8% (95% CI 4.3% to 5.3%) among those not receiving QPT. After adjustment for patient characteristics and concomitant treatments, QPT use was associated with a relative reduction of 50% in in-hospital COVID-19 related mortality (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.66 P <0.001). This association was consistent across subgroups by sex and age. Meanwhile, the incidences of acute liver injury (8.9% [95% CI, 7.8% to 10.1%] vs. 9.9% [95% CI, 9.2% to 10.7%]; odds ratio, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.81% to 1.14%], P =0.658) and acute kidney injury (1.6% [95% CI, 1.2% to 2.2%] vs. 3.0% [95% CI, 2.6% to 3.5%]; odds ratio, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.62 to 1.17], P =0.318) were comparable between patients receiving QPT and those not receiving QPT. The major study limitations included that the study was an observational study based on real-world data rather than a randomized control trial, and the quality of data could be affected by the accuracy and completeness of medical records. CONCLUSIONS: : QPT was associated with a substantially lower risk of in-hospital mortality, without extra risk of acute liver injury or acute kidney injury among patients hospitalized with COVID-19."
353,10162021043297,"BACKGROUND Recent studies revealed that most discharged patients with COVID-19 suffered ongoing symptoms months later. Rehabilitation interventions can help address the consequences of COVID-19. These include medically, physically, cognitively and psychologically related problems. To our knowledge, no studies have investigated the effects of rehabilitation following discharge from hospital. OBJECTIVE The specific aims of this project are to investigate the effects of a 12-week exercise program on pulmonary fibrosis in recovering COVID-19 patients. A further aim will be to examine how Chinese herbal medicines, gut microbiome and its metabolites regulate immune function and possibly autoimmune deficiency in the rehabilitation process. METHODS In this triple-blinded, randomized, parallel groups, controlled clinical trial, we will recruit adult patients with COVID-19 who have been discharged from the hospital in Hong Kong and are suffering from impaired lung function and pulmonary function. A total of 172 eligible patients will be randomized into four equal groups: 1) cardiorespiratory exercise plus Chinese herbal medicines group, 2) cardiorespiratory exercise only group, 3) Chinese herbal medicines only group and 4) waiting list group (in which participants will receive Chinese herbal medicines after 24 weeks). These treatments will be administered for 12 weeks with a 12-week follow-up period. Primary outcomes include dyspnea, fatigue, lung function, pulmonary function, blood oxygen levels, immune function, blood coagulation, and related blood biochemistry. Measurements will be recorded prior to initiating the above treatments and repeated at the 13th and 25th weeks of the study. The primary analysis is aimed at comparing the outcomes between groups throughout the study period with alpha level of 0.05 (two-tailed). RESULTS The trial has been approved by the university ethics committee following the Declaration of Helsinki (Approval Number: REC/19-20/0504) in 2020. The trial has not been recruiting patients. The data collection will be completed in 24 months from 01 January 2021 to 31 December 2022. CONCLUSIONS Given that COVID-19 and its sequelae would persist in human populations, important findings from this study would provide valuable insights into the mechanisms and processes in COVID-19 rehabilitation.

354,10172021059216,"SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospital areas is of a particular concern, since the close interaction between health care personnel and patients diagnosed with COVID-19, which allows virus to be easily spread between them and subsequently to their families and communities. Preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare personnel is essential to reduce the frequency of infections and outbreaks during the pandemic considering that they work in high-risk areas. In this research, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were tested in vitro and shown to have an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 infection in cultured cells. Subsequently, we assess the effects of mouthwash and nose rinse with ARGOVIT silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 contagion in health workers consider as high-risk group of acquiring the infection in the General Tijuana Hospital, Mexico, a hospital for the exclusive recruitment of patients diagnosed with COVID-19. We present a prospective randomized study of 231 participants that was carried out for 9 weeks (during the declaration of a pandemic). The ""experimental"" group was instructed to do mouthwash and nose rinse with the AgNPs solution; the ""control"" group was instructed to do mouthwashes and nose rinse in a conventional way. The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was significantly lower in the ""experimental"" group (two participants of 114, 1.8%) compared to the ""control"" group (thirty-three participants of 117, 28.2%), with a 84.8% efficiency. We conclude that the mouth and nasal rinse with AgNPs helps in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health personnel who are exposed to patients diagnosed with COVID-19."

Forty weaning piglets in four groups were fed diets supplemented with 40 or 110 ppm zinc as zinc oxide, 110 ppm as Zn-Lysinate, or 2500 ppm as zinc oxide. Host zinc homeostasis, intestinal zinc fractions, and ileal nutrient digestibility were determined as main nutritional and physiological factors putatively driving colon microbial ecology. Metagenomic sequencing of colon microbiota revealed only clear differences at genus level for the group receiving 2500 ppm zinc oxide. However, a clear group differentiation according to dietary zinc concentration and source was observed at species level. Functional analysis revealed significant differences in genes related to stress response, mineral, and carbohydrate metabolism. Taxonomic and functional gene differences were accompanied with clear effects in microbial metabolite concentration. Finally, a selection of certain antibiotic resistance genes by dietary zinc was observed. This study sheds further light onto the consequences of concentration and chemical form of dietary zinc on microbial ecology measures and the resistome in the porcine colon."
356,100620200610959,"Polymerase Chain reaction (PCR) is a key tool to diagnose Covid-19. Yet access to PCR is often limited. In this paper, we develop a clinical strategy for prescribing PCR to patients based on data from COVIDOM, a French cohort of 54,000 patients with clinically suspected Covid-19 including 12,810 patients tested by PCR. Using a machine learning algorithm (a decision tree), we show that symptoms alone are sufficient to predict PCR outcome with a mean average precision of 86%. We identify combinations of symptoms that are predictive of PCR positivity (90% for anosmia/ageusia) or negativity (only 30% of PCR+ for a subgroup with cardiopulmonary symptoms): in both cases, PCR provides little added diagnostic value. We deduce a prescribing strategy based on clinical presentation that can improve the global efficiency of PCR testing."
357,10062020067352,"COVID 19 is disease caused by novel corona virus, SARS-CoV2 originated in China most probably of Bat origin. Till date, no specific vaccine or drug has been discovered to tackle the infections caused by SARS-CoV2. In response to this pandemic, we utilized bioinformatics knowledge to develop efficient vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV2. Designed vaccine was rich in effective BCR and TCR epitopes screened from the sequence of S-protein of SARS-CoV2. Predicted BCR and TCR epitopes were antigenic in nature non-toxic and probably non-allergen. Modelled and refined tertiary structure was predicted as valid for further use. Protein-Protein interaction prediction of TLR2/4 and designed vaccine indicates promising binding. Designed multiepitope vaccine has induced cell mediated and humoral immunity along with increased interferon gamma response. Macrophages and dendritic cells were also found increased over the vaccine exposure. In silico codon optimization and cloning in expression vector indicates that vaccine can be efficiently expressed in E. coli. In conclusion, predicted vaccine is a good antigen, probable no allergen and has potential to induce cellular and humoral immunity."
358,101220201210505,"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) in January 2020 declared outbreak of novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, an international public health emergency. It was stated that there was high COVID-19 spread risk to various other countries across world. According to WHO in March 2020, COVID-19 was characterized as pandemic. However, this sudden crisis is generating great deal of stress, anxiety, and depression throughout the world. AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the psychological impact and various associated factors during the developing COVID-19 situation among both the healthcare and non-healthcare working professionals in India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was an observation-based cross-sectional study conducted during the lockdown period and following the lifting of the lockdown for a total of 3 months duration. A structured questionnaire was send via the (email) electronic mail system to a target population of 350 people. Out of which 300 responded. The questionnaire was comprised of study variables: (a) Gender; (b) age-group range which was categorized into- (i) Between 30 snf 50 years and (ii) More than 50 years; (c) Presence of any comorbid medical condition; psychological symptoms of- (d) insomnia; (e) anxiety; and (f) depression. Statistical analysis was performed using the Chi-square test for determining significance. RESULTS: Mean ± SD values for age were found to be 35.54 ± 6.09; 33.84 ± 7.87; 32.16 ± 5.89 and 55.76 ± 8.98 for physicians, nurses, technical staff, and non-healthcare professionals while the percentages of male study participants was found to be 37.2%, 15%, 57%, and 65% and female study participants was 62.8%, 85%, 43%, and 35% for the physicians, nursing staff, technicians, and non-healthcare professionals. Depression, insomnia, and anxiety between healthcare and non-healthcare professional workers, demonstrated significant P values of 0.05, 0.03, and 0.02, respectively. CONCLUSION: The present study has shown a significant psychological impact arising from this crisis."
359,10122020120752,"BACKGROUND: Patients with COVID-19 most commonly report respiratory symptoms, with a minority reporting gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in currently available reports. Additionally, little is known about the symptoms of anosmia/hyposmia, ageusia, and dysgeusia anecdotally seen in COVID-19 patients, which may be considered both GI and sensory/neurological manifestations of infection. METHODS: We interviewed 7 patients via oral inquiries and a questionnaire, collecting data on subject symptoms and their durations. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to confirm 2 of these cases. RESULTS: We report a familial cluster of 7 COVID-19 cases, 5 of whom reported sensory symptoms of anosmia/hyposmia (5/7), ageusia/hypogeusia (5/7), and/or dysgeusia (3/7). All 7 cases reported GI involvement with one or more symptom of: nausea (5/7), diarrhea (4/7), abdominal pain (3/7), anorexia (3/7), and emesis (2/7). Figure 1. Timeline of Symptoms and Exposure to Index Case in Familial COVID-19 Cluster [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: This frequency of GI symptoms is high relative to currently available epidemiological reports, which also infrequently report on sensory symptoms. The mechanistic underpinnings of GI and sensory symptoms in COVID-19 warrant close consideration and analysis, especially as it relates to reducing disease transmission. COVID-19 exhibits wide variation in duration, severity, and progression of symptoms, even within a familial cluster. DISCLOSURES: All Authors: No reported disclosures"
360,10112020116742,"Surveillance is the backbone of any disease control program. Data must be representative, timely, and consistent. Collection of data must be systematic. Analysis of data should include analysis by time, place, and person. Data sources can be varied, and have a potentially wide scope from death certification through clinical illness and from laboratory reports to social factors. The interpretation of surveillance data is a skill which must also take into account the strengths and weaknesses of the source data. Informed feedback is an essential final step to action."
361,10052020051342,"One of the main problems in quantum information systems is the presence of errors due to noise. Many quantum error correcting codes have been designed to deal with generic errors. In this paper we construct new stabilizer codes able to correct a given number [Formula: see text] of generic Pauli [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] errors, plus a number [Formula: see text] of Pauli errors of a specified type (e.g., [Formula: see text] errors). These codes can be of interest when the quantum channel is asymmetric, i.e., when some types of error occur more frequently than others. For example, we design a [[9, 1]] quantum error correcting code able to correct up to one generic qubit error plus one [Formula: see text] error in arbitrary positions. According to a generalized version of the quantum Hamming bound, it is the shortest code with this error correction capability."
362,10112020119471,"Background: Monitoring Sustainable Development Goal indicators (SDGs) and their targets plays an important role in understanding and advocating for improved health outcomes for all countries. We present the United Nations (UN) Inter-agency groups’ efforts to support countries to report on SDG health indicators, project progress towards 2030 targets and build country accountability for action. Objective: We highlight common principles and practices of each Inter-agency group and the progress made towards SDG 3 targets using seven health indicators as examples. The indicators used provide examples of best practice for modelling estimates and projections using standard methods, transparent data collection and country consultations. Methods: Practices common to the UN agencies include multi-UN agency participation, expert groups to advise on estimation methods, transparent publication of methods and data inputs, use of UN-derived population estimates, country consultations, and a common reporting platform to present results. Our seven examples illustrate how estimates, using mostly Bayesian models, make use of country data to track progress towards SDG targets for 2030. Results: Progress has been made over the past decade. However, none of the seven indicators are on track to achieve their respective SDG targets by 2030. Accelerated efforts are needed, especially in low- and middle-income countries, to reduce the burden of maternal, child, communicable and noncommunicable disease mortality, and to provide access to modern methods of family planning to all women. Conclusion: Our analysis shows the benefit of UN interagency monitoring which prioritizes transparent country data sources, UN population estimates and life tables, and rigorous but replicable modelling methods. Countries are supported to build capacity for data collection, analysis and reporting. Through these monitoring efforts we support countries to tackle even the most intransient health issues, including the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 that is reversing the hard-earned gains of all countries."
363,100920200912980,"It is demanded to supply foods with good quality for all the humans. With the advent of aging society, palatable and healthy foods are required to improve the quality of life and reduce the burden of finance for medical expenditure. Food hydrocolloids can contribute to this demand by versatile functions such as thickening, gelling, stabilising, and emulsifying, controlling texture and flavour release in food processing. Molar mass effects on viscosity and diffusion in liquid foods, and on mechanical and other physical properties of solid and semi-solid foods and films are overviewed. In these functions, the molar mass is one of the key factors, and therefore, the effects of molar mass on various health problems related to noncommunicable diseases or symptoms such as cancer, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, constipation, high blood pressure, knee pain, osteoporosis, cystic fibrosis and dysphagia are described. Understanding these problems only from the viewpoint of molar mass is limited since other structural characteristics, conformation, branching, blockiness in copolymers such as pectin and alginate, degree of substitution as well as the position of the substituents are sometimes the determining factor rather than the molar mass. Nevertheless, comparison of different behaviours and functions in different polymers from the viewpoint of molar mass is expected to be useful to find a common characteristics, which may be helpful to understand the mechanism in other problems."

365,10172021058108,"BACKGROUND: The impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on wellbeing and health has so far been studied using mostly cross-sectional designs. To place recent findings into context, we compared symptoms and functional health status in two independent samples assessed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Participants were recruited via an online panel using quota sampling. We assessed symptoms, functional health, and global quality of life with the EORTC QLQ-C30 in two general population samples in Spain (collected in July 2019 and April 2020). We also assessed several COVID-19 related variables, such as adherence to social distancing. RESULTS: Data from N = 1010 participants before the pandemic (mean age 47.1 years, 50.5% female) were compared with data from N = 504 participants during the pandemic (mean age 47.1 years, 50.8% female). Participants during the pandemic (vs. before the pandemic) reported lower role functioning and emotional functioning, as well as less symptom burden. A lower degree of social distancing was associated with better functional health and lower symptom burden. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate an impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on functional health and symptom burden in the Spanish general population. The comparison of before and during the pandemic can be used to benchmark results raised only during the pandemic.

366,10162021042189,"Reinfections with SARS-CoV-2 have already been documented in humans, although its real incidence is currently unknown. Besides having great impact on public health, this phenomenon raises the question if immunity generated by a single infection is sufficient to provide sterilizing/protective immunity to a subsequent SARS-CoV-2 re-exposure. The Golden Syrian hamster is a manageable animal model to explore immunological mechanisms able to counteract COVID-19, as it recapitulates pathological aspects of mild to moderately affected patients. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2-inoculated hamsters resolve infection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts within seven days upon inoculation with the Cat01 (G614) SARS-CoV-2 isolate. Three weeks after primary challenge, and despite high titers of neutralizing antibodies, half of the animals were susceptible to reinfection by both identical (Cat01, G614) and variant (WA/1, D614) SARS-CoV-2 isolates. However, upon re-inoculation, only nasal tissues were transiently infected with much lower viral replication than those observed after the first inoculation. These data indicate that a primary SARS-CoV-2 infection is not sufficient to elicit a sterilizing immunity in hamster models but protects against lung disease."
367,10132021018897,"Heavy metal contamination in herbal medicines is a global threat to human beings especially at levels above known threshold concentrations. The concentrations of five heavy metals cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), mercury (Hg) and copper (Cu) were investigated using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) with 1773 samples around the world. According to Chinese Pharmacopoeia, 30.51% (541) samples were detected with at least one over-limit metal. The over-limit ratio for Pb was 5.75% (102), Cd at 4.96% (88), As at 4.17% (74), Hg at 3.78% (67), and of Cu, 1.75% (31). For exposure assessment, Pb, Cd, As, and Hg have resulted in higher than acceptable risks in 25 kinds of herbs. The maximal Estimated Daily Intake of Pb in seven herbs, of Cd in five, of Hg in four, and As in three exceeded their corresponding Provisional Tolerable Daily Intakes. In total 25 kinds of herbs present an unacceptable risk as assessed with the Hazard Quotient or Hazard Index. Additionally, the carcinogenic risks were all under acceptable limits. Notably, As posed the highest risk in all indicators including Estimated Daily Intake, Hazard Index, and carcinogenic risks. Therefore further study on enrichment effect of different states of As and special attention to monitoring shall be placed on As related contamination."

AIM To explore the transitional care experiences of patients with ESLD and their caregivers in order to identify their supportive care needs. METHODS We conducted interviews with 15 patients with ESLD and 14 informal caregivers. We used semi-structured interview guides to explore their experiences since the diagnosis of ESLD including their care transitions. Two raters coded interviews independently (κ = 0.95) using template analysis. RESULTS Participants reported feeling unprepared to manage their informational, psychosocial, and practical care needs as they transitioned from hospital to home after the diagnosis of ESLD. Delay in the timely receipt of supportive care services addressing these care needs resulted in hospital readmissions, emotional distress, caregiver burnout, reduced work capacity, and financial hardship. Participants shared the following resources that they perceived would improve their quality of care: (1) discharge checklist, (2) online resources, (3) mental health support, (4) caregiver support and training, and (5) financial navigation. CONCLUSION Transitional care models that attend to the informational, psychosocial, and practical domains of care are needed to better support patients with ESLD and their caregivers at the time of diagnosis and beyond. Without attending to the multidimensional care needs of newly diagnosed patients with ESLD and their caregivers, they are at risk of burdensome transitions of care, high healthcare utilization, and poor health-related quality of life."
369,10022020021064,"Since the first identified individual of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection on Jan 20, 2020 in South Korea, the number of confirmed cases rapidly increased. As of Feb 26, 2020, 1,261 cases of COVID-19 including 12 deaths were confirmed in South Korea. Using the incidence data of COVID-19, we estimate the reproduction number at 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4-1.6), which indicates sustained transmission and support the implementation of social distancing measures to rapidly control the outbreak."
370,101620210412133,"Diarrhea occurs in 2-50% of cases of COVID-19 (∼8% is average across series). The diarrhea does not appear to account for the disease mortality and its contribution to the morbidity has not been defined, even though it is a component of Long Covid or post-infectious aspects of the disease. Even less is known about the pathophysiologic mechanism of the diarrhea. To begin to understand the pathophysiology of COVID-19 diarrhea, we exposed human enteroid monolayers obtained from five healthy subjects and made from duodenum, jejunum, and proximal colon to live SARS-CoV-2 and virus like particles (VLPs) made from exosomes expressing SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins (Spike, Nucleocapsid, Membrane and Envelope). Results: 1) Live virus was exposed apically for 90 min, then washed out and studied 2 and 5 days later. SARS-Cov-2 was taken up by enteroids and live virus was present in lysates and in the apical>>basolateral media of polarized enteroids 48 h after exposure. This is the first demonstration of basolateral appearance of live virus after apical exposure. High vRNA concentration was detected in cell lysates and in the apical and basolateral media up to 5 days after exposure. 2) Two days after viral exposure, cytokine measurements of media showed significantly increased levels of IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1. 3) Two days after viral exposure, mRNA levels of ACE2, NHE3 and DRA were reduced but there was no change in mRNA of CFTR. NHE3 protein was also decreased. 4) Live viral studies were mimicked by some studies with VLP exposure for 48 h. VLPs with Spike-D614G bound to the enteroid apical surface and was taken up; this resulted in decreased mRNA levels of ACE2, NHE3, DRA and CFTR. 4) VLP effects were determined on active anion secretion measured with the Ussing chamber/voltage clamp technique. S-D614G acutely exposed to apical surface of human ileal enteroids did not alter the short-circuit current (Isc). However, VLPS-D614G exposure to enteroids that were pretreated for ∼24 h with IL-6 plus IL-8 induced a concentration dependent increase in Isc indicating stimulated anion secretion, that was delayed in onset by ∼8 min. The anion secretion was inhibited by apical exposure to a specific calcium activated Cl channel (CaCC) inhibitor (AO1) but not by a specific CFTR inhibitor (BP027); was inhibited by basolateral exposure to the K channel inhibit clortimazole; and was prevented by pretreatment with the calcium buffer BAPTA-AM. 5) The calcium dependence of the VLP-induced increase in Isc was studied in Caco-2/BBe cells stably expressing the genetically encoded Ca2+ sensor GCaMP6s. 24 h pretreatment with IL-6/IL-8 did not alter intracellular Ca2+. However, in IL-6/IL-8 pretreated cells, VLP S-D614G caused appearance of Ca2+waves and an overall increase in intracellular Ca2+ with a delay of ∼10 min after VLP addition. We conclude that the diarrhea of COVID-19 appears to an example of a calcium dependent inflammatory diarrhea that involves both acutely stimulated Ca2+ dependent anion secretion (stimulated Isc) that involves CaCC and likely inhibition of neutral NaCl absorption (decreased NHE3 protein and mRNA and decreased DRA mRNA)."
371,10172021051892,"Targeting the polyamine biosynthetic pathway by inhibiting ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is a powerful approach in the fight against diverse viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO, eflornithine) is the best-known inhibitor of ODC and a broad-spectrum, unique therapeutical agent. Nevertheless, its pharmacokinetic profile is not perfect, especially when large doses are required in antiviral treatment. This article presents a holistic study focusing on the molecular and supramolecular structure of DFMO and the design of its analogues toward the development of safer and more effective formulations. In this context, we provide the first deep insight into the supramolecular system of DFMO supplemented by a comprehensive, qualitative and quantitative survey of non-covalent interactions via Hirshfeld surface, molecular electrostatic potential, enrichment ratio and energy frameworks analysis visualizing 3-D topology of interactions in order to understand the differences in the cooperativity of interactions involved in the formation of either basic or large synthons (Long-range Synthon Aufbau Modules, LSAM) at the subsequent levels of well-organized supramolecular self-assembly, in comparison with the ornithine structure. In the light of the drug discovery, supramolecular studies of amino acids, essential constituents of proteins, are of prime importance. In brief, the same amino-carboxy synthons are observed in the bio-system containing DFMO. DFT calculations revealed that the biological environment changes the molecular structure of DFMO only slightly. The ADMET profile of structural modifications of DFMO and optimization of its analogue as a new promising drug via molecular docking are discussed in detail."
372,10132021016662,"This paper provides the first evidence of the causal effect of COVID-19 on metro use using real-time data from the Taipei Metro System in Taiwan. In contrast to other cities or countries, Taiwan did not enforce strict social lockdowns or mandatory stay-at-home orders to combat COVID-19. The major prevention strategies to the pandemic in Taiwan include promoting social distancing, mandating the wearing of face masks in public areas, and requiring all international arrivals to quarantine for 14 days. Using administrative data on confirmed cases of COVID-19 and ridership from metro stations with the difference-in-differences model, we find that an additional new confirmed case of COVID-19 reduces metro use by 1.43% after controlling for local socio-demographic variables associated with ridership and the number of international arrivals to Taiwan. This result implies that the reduction in metro trips is attributable to decreases in residents' use of public transportation due to perceived health risks. Furthermore, the effect of COVID-19 on metro use disproportionally impacts stations with different characteristics. The effect is more pronounced for metro stations connected to night markets, shopping centers, or colleges. Although decreases in metro ridership lower the revenue of the Taipei Metro System, our results indicate a tradeoff between increased financial burdens of public transportation systems and reducing medical expenses associated with COVID-19."
373,101020201012247,"The global SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and subsequent lockdown had a significant impact on people’s daily lives, with strong implications for stress levels due to the threat of contagion and restrictions to freedom. Given the link between high stress levels and adverse physical and mental consequences, the COVID-19 pandemic is certainly a global public health issue. In the present study, we assessed the effect of the pandemic on stress levels in N = 2053 Italian adults, and characterized more vulnerable individuals on the basis of sociodemographic features and stable psychological traits. A set of 18 psycho-social variables, generalized regressions, and predictive machine learning approaches were leveraged. We identified higher levels of perceived stress in the study sample relative to Italian normative values. Higher levels of distress were found in women, participants with lower income, and participants living with others. Higher rates of emotional stability and self-control, as well as a positive coping style and internal locus of control, emerged as protective factors. Predictive learning models identified participants with high perceived stress, with a sensitivity greater than 76%. The results suggest a characterization of people who are more vulnerable to experiencing high levels of stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. This characterization may contribute to early and targeted intervention strategies."

375,10172021050554,"In this article, I part from the argument developed by Valsiner in a text on pathways to development and education (Valsiner, 2008): he claims we need to move from the static ontology of being—which asks “what is X?” to the epistemology of becoming—which asks “what is X becoming.” He then asks the consequent question: how to do empirical work on that new key? How to research on a crucial feature of human development—the self-reflexive intentional relating with the anticipated future? This article is an attempt to develop the epistemology of becoming on an empirical level, by analyzing my self-writings from the period I became a mother. I show that becoming a mother is a developmental process that happens through time and through the performing of daily activities such as nursing, bathing the baby and so on. In order to go beyond the study of the epistemology of becoming, I propose the poetics of performing."
376,101320210110818,"Dementia poses important medical and societal challenges, and of all health risks people face in life, dementia is one of the most feared. Recent research indicates that up to about 40% of all cases of dementia might be preventable. A series of environmental, social, and medical risk-factors have been identified that should be targeted from midlife onwards when people are still cognitively healthy. At first glance, this seems not merely advisable, but even imperative. However, these new developments trigger a series of new ethical questions and concerns which have hardly been addressed to date. Pro-active ethical reflection, however, is crucial to ensure that the interests and well-being of those affected, ultimately all of us, are adequately respected. This is the goal of the current contribution. Against the background of a concrete case in primary dementia prevention, it provides a systematic overview of the current ethical literature and sketches an ethical research agenda. First, possible benefits of increased well-being must be balanced with the burdens of being engaged in particularly long-term interventions for which it is unclear whether they will ever pay out on a personal level. Second, while knowledge about one’s options to maintain brain health might empower people, it might also undermine autonomy, put high social pressure on people, medicalize healthy adults, and stigmatize those who still develop dementia. Third, while synergistic effects might occur, the ideals of dementia prevention might also conflict with other health and non-health related values people hold in life."
377,100920200913446,"BACKGROUND: This study was aimed to investigate the application of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies in diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. METHOD: This study enrolled a total of 178 patients at Huangshi Central Hospital from January to February 2020. Among them, 68 patients were SARS-CoV-2 infected, confirmed with nucleic acid test (NAT) and CT imaging. Nine patients were in the suspected group (NAT negative) with fever and other respiratory symptoms. 101 patients were in the control group with other diseases and negative to SARS-CoV-2 infection. After serum samples were collected, SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies were tested by chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) for all patients. RESULTS: The specificity of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was 99.01% (100/101) and 96.04% (97/101), respectively, and the sensitivity was 88.24% (60/68) and 97.06% (66/68), respectively. The combined detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies was 98.53% (67/68). CONCLUSION: Combined detection of serum SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies had better sensitivity compared with single IgM or IgG antibody testing, which can be used as an important diagnostic tool for SARS-CoV-2 infection and a screening tool of potential SARS-CoV-2 carriers in clinics, hospitals, and accredited scientific laboratories."
378,10082020081699,"A digital microfluidic biochip (DMB) is an attractive platform for automating laboratory procedures in microbiology. To overcome the problem of cross-contamination due to fouling of the electrode surface in traditional DMBs, a contactless liquid handling biochip technology, referred to as acoustofluidics, has recently been proposed. A major challenge in operating this platform is the need for a control signal of frequency 24 MHz and voltage range +-10/+-20 V to activate the IDT units in the biochip. In this paper, we present a hardware design that can efficiently activate/de-activated each IDT, and can fully automate an bioprotocol. We also present a fault-tolerant synthesis technique that allows us to automatically map biomolecular protocols to acoustofluidic biochips. We develop and experimentally validate a velocity model, and use it to guide co-optimization for operation scheduling, module placement, and droplet routing in the presence of IDT faults. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed synthesis method. Our results are expected to open new research directions on design automation of digital acoustofluidic biochips."
379,10102020102936,"The new coronavirus, known as ""SARS-CoV-2""; is the cause of one of the most prevalent infectious viral diseases that was recently announced pandemic by the world health organization. Ongoing research in the fields of prevention, management, and therapy establishes a functional scaffold for clinics during the time of crisis. To obtain this goal, it is necessary that all pathophysiologic aspects of COVID-19 from infection to predisposing backgrounds of infection be identified, so that all the ambiguities of researchers regarding transmission mechanisms, variable clinical manifestation, and therapeutic response can be solved. Here, we firstly discuss about the homology screening between nCoV-2019 and beta-coronavirus family using phylogenetic analyses. Secondly, we analyzed the viral motifs to show that viral entry into the host cells requires a primary activation step performed by FURIN and FURIN-like-mediated enzymatic cleavage on the structural glycoprotein. The cleavage increases viral performance by 1000 folds. We then present a comprehensive view on host cells and the significance of gene variants affecting activation enzymes, supportive entry, and spread mechanisms in humans including renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) a pathway results in certain phenotypes or exacerbate infection-related phenotypes in different organs, hence causes variable clinical manifestations. This is followed by discussing about the importance of personalized medicine in nCoV-2019 exposure. Moreover, chemical drugs prescribed for individuals affected with COVID-19, as well as genes involved in drug transport and metabolisms are reviewed as a prelude to drug response. Finally, we suggest some therapeutic approaches developed based on new methods and technology such as anti-sense therapy and antibodies."
380,10132021019551,"SARS-CoV-2 epidemics quickly propagated worldwide, sorting virus genomic variants in newly established propagules of infections. Stochasticity in transmission within and between countries or an actual selective advantage could explain the global high frequency reached by some genomic variants. Using statistical analyses, demographic reconstructions, and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the globally invasive G614 spike variant i) underwent a significant demographic expansion in most countries not explained by stochastic effects nor by overrepresentation in clinical samples; ii) increases the spike S1/S2 furin-like site conformational plasticity (short-range effect), and iii) modifies the internal motion of the receptor-binding domain affecting its cross-connection with other functional domains (long-range effect). Our results support the hypothesis of a selective advantage at the basis of the spread of the G614 variant, which we suggest may be due to structural modification of the spike protein at the S1/S2 proteolytic site, and provides structural information to guide the design of variant-specific drugs."
381,10142021020511,"As part of one of the five major national development strategies, the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB), including the three national-level urban agglomerations (the Cheng-Yu urban agglomeration (CY-UA), the Yangtze River Middle-Reach urban agglomeration (YRMR-UA), and the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration (YRD-UA)), plays an important role in China’s urban development and economic construction. However, the rapid economic growth of the past decades has caused frequent regional air pollution incidents, as indicated by high levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Therefore, a driving force factor analysis based on the PM2.5 of the whole area would provide more information. This paper focuses on the three urban agglomerations in the YREB and uses exploratory data analysis and geostatistics methods to describe the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of air quality based on long-term PM2.5 series data from 2015 to 2018. First, the main driving factor of the spatial stratified heterogeneity of PM2.5 was determined through the Geodetector model, and then the influence mechanism of the factors with strong explanatory power was extrapolated using the Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) models. The results showed that the number of enterprises, social public vehicles, total precipitation, wind speed, and green coverage in the built-up area had the most significant impacts on the distribution of PM2.5. The regression by MGWR was found to be more efficient than that by traditional Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), further showing that the main factors varied significantly among the three urban agglomerations in affecting the special and temporal features."

As limited data were available, this study was conducted to analyse the use of the Head and Neck Cancer Risk Calculator version 2 in clinical practice. METHOD: Patients undergoing telephone triage in a two-week wait referral clinic were included. Data were collected and analysed using appropriate methods. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients in the study were risk-stratified into low-risk (51.6 per cent, 33 of 64), moderate-risk (14.1 per cent, 9 of 64) and high-risk (34.4 per cent, 22 of 64) groups. Of the patients, 53.1 per cent (34 of 64) avoided an urgent hospital visit, and 96.9 per cent (62 of 64) were cancer free, while 3.1 per cent (2 of 64) were found to have a head and neck malignancy. The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and accuracy were 50.00 per cent, 66.13 per cent, 99.92 per cent and 66.11 per cent, respectively. CONCLUSION: It is reasonable to use the calculator for triaging purposes, but it must always be accompanied by a meticulous clinical thought process."

We used a spatiotemporal cluster detection algorithm to monitor SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics and defined spatial cluster persistence as the time in days from emergence to disappearance. Using spatial cluster persistence measured outcome and a deprivation index based on neighborhood-level census socioeconomic data, stratified survival functions were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Population density adjusted Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression models were then used to examine the association between neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 clusters. Results: SARS-CoV-2 clusters persisted significantly longer in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods. In the Cox PH model, the standardized deprivation index was associated with an increased spatial cluster persistence (hazard ratio [HR], 1.43 [95% CI, 1.28–1.59]). The adjusted tercile-specific deprivation index HR was 1.82 [95% CI, 1.56–2.17]. Conclusions: The increased risk of infection of disadvantaged individuals may also be due to the persistence of community transmission. These findings further highlight the need for interventions mitigating inequalities in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and thus, of serious illness and mortality."
384,101020201011766,"In view of the exceptional public health situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, a consensus work has been promoted from the ethics group of the Spanish Society of Intensive, Critical Medicine and Coronary Units (SEMICYUC), with the objective of finding some answers from ethics to the crossroads between the increase of people with intensive care needs and the effective availability of means. In a very short period, the medical practice framework has been changed to a ‘catastrophe medicine’ scenario, with the consequent change in the decision-making parameters. In this context, the allocation of resources or the prioritization of treatment become crucial elements, and it is important to have an ethical reference framework to be able to make the necessary clinical decisions. For this, a process of narrative review of the evidence has been carried out, followed by unsystematic consensus of experts, which has resulted in both the publication of a position paper and recommendations from SEMICYUC itself, and the consensus between 18 scientific societies and 5 institutes/chairs of bioethics and palliative care of a framework document of reference for general ethical recommendations in this context of crisis."
385,100820200811651,"The global Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has affected more than eight million people. There is an urgent need to investigate how the adaptive immunity is established in COVID-19 patients. In this study, we profiled adaptive immune cells of PBMCs from recovered COVID-19 patients with varying disease severity using single-cell RNA and TCR/BCR V(D)J sequencing. The sequencing data revealed SARS-CoV-2-specific shuffling of adaptive immune repertories and COVID-19-induced remodeling of peripheral lymphocytes. Characterization of variations in the peripheral T and B cells from the COVID-19 patients revealed a positive correlation of humoral immune response and T-cell immune memory with disease severity. Sequencing and functional data revealed SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell immune memory in the convalescent COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we also identified novel antigens that are responsive in the convalescent patients. Altogether, our study reveals adaptive immune repertories underlying pathogenesis and recovery in severe versus mild COVID-19 patients, providing valuable information for potential vaccine and therapeutic development against SARS-CoV-2 infection."
386,10082020084911,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has shown how a newly emergent communicable disease can lay considerable burden on public health. To avoid system collapse, governments have resorted to several social distancing measures. In Belgium, this included a lockdown and a following period of phased re-opening. Methods: A representative sample of Belgian adults was asked about their contact behaviour from mid-April to mid-July, during different stages of the intervention measures in Belgium. Use of personal protection equipment (face masks) and compliance to hygienic measures was also reported. We estimated the expected reproduction number computing the ratio of R0 with respect to pre-pandemic data. Results: During the first two waves (the first month) of the survey, the reduction in the average number of contacts was around 80% and was quite consistent across all age-classes. The average number of contacts increased over time, particularly for the younger age classes, still remaining significantly lower than pre-pandemic values. Since the end of May, the estimated reproduction number has a median value larger than one, although with a wide dispersion. Conclusions: We have shown how a rapidly deployed survey can measure compliance to social distancing and assess its impact on COVID-19 spread. Monitoring the effectiveness of social distancing recommendations is of paramount importance to avoid further waves of COVID-19."

We identified 11 HRV-infected patients by polymerase chain reactions of the HRV genes among 151 outpatients with fever. All nine adult patients had underlying diseases and finally improved with the appropriate treatment in this COVID-19 pandemic period. Differential diagnosis between HRV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection will be needed to save lives and medical resources."
388,10172021053075,"To prevent and reduce the transmission of the coronavirus to vulnerable populations, the World Health Organization recommended the restriction of visitors to nursing homes. It was recognised that such restrictions could have profound impact on residents and their families. Nonetheless, these measures were strictly imposed over a prolonged period in many countries; impeding families from remaining involved in their relatives' care and diluting the meaningful connections for residents with society. It is timely to explore the impact of public health measures on people living in nursing homes from an ethical perspective. In order to foreground the ethical dimensions of the implications of visitor restrictions in nursing homes, we compiled an ethical case that reflects some recent experiences of nursing homes residents and their families, in the Irish Republic. We describe a series of events encountered by a woman and her family during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020 and we deploy an ethical decision-making tool to guide and structure our analysis. Our case analysis draws attention to ethical principles that are relevant to explicating the ethical duties and obligations that arise in relation to the interests, well-being, and safety of residents and their families, as well as nursing home staff and the wider community during a pandemic. These include the right of autonomy, trust, minimising harm, and proportionality. We conclude that a number of different strategies should be adopted by nursing homes and relevant regulatory bodies. This includes honest, regular communication between the nursing home staff, the resident and their family. Central to communications is the resident's wishes, their current clinical status and the all-important wider public health obligations. National strategies include mass vaccination, the timely provision of guidance documents and interventions from regulatory bodies that are patient-centred, adaptable, and cost effective."
389,100920200910167,"BACKGROUND: Patients with comorbid conditions have a higher risk of mortality with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection, but the impact on heart failure patients living near a disease hotspot is unknown. Therefore, we sought to characterize the prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 in a live registry of heart failure patients across an integrated health care system in Connecticut. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, the Yale Heart Failure Registry (NCT04237701) that includes 26,703 patients with heart failure across a 6-hospital integrated health care system in Connecticut was queried on April 16th, 2020 for all patients tested for COVID-19. Sociodemographic and geospatial data as well as, clinical management, respiratory failure, and patient mortality were obtained via the real-time registry. Data on COVID-19 specific care was extracted by retrospective chart review. RESULTS: COVID-19 testing was performed on 900 symptomatic patients, comprising 3.4% of the Yale Heart Failure Registry (N = 26,703). Overall, 206 (23%) were COVID- 19+. As compared to COVID-19-, these patients were more likely to be older, black, have hypertension, coronary artery disease, and were less likely to be on renin angiotensin blockers (P<0.05, all). COVID-19- patients tended to be more diffusely spread across the state whereas COVID-19+ were largely clustered around urban centers. 20% of COVID-19+ patients died, and age was associated with increased risk of death [OR 1.92 95% CI (1.33–2.78); P<0.001]. Among COVID-19+ patients who were ≥85 years of age rates of hospitalization were 87%, rates of death 36%, and continuing hospitalization 62% at time of manuscript preparation. CONCLUSIONS: In this real-world snapshot of COVID-19 infection among a large cohort of heart failure patients, we found that a small proportion had undergone testing. Patients found to be COVID-19+ tended to be black with multiple comorbidities and clustered around lower socioeconomic status communities. Elderly COVID-19+ patients were very likely to be admitted to the hospital and experience high rates of mortality."
390,101120201110050,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a far-reaching and unprecedented influence on economies worldwide. It has also impacted on the global population’s mental health and caused negative psychosocial effects, which may lead to psychological crises. During the pandemic, the challenges for quarantine hotel employees are not only the increased workloads created by operating a quarantine hotel but also high psychological stress associated with job insecurity, risk of exposure and contagion for themselves, their friends and families. This research attempts to explore COVID-19-related depression, anxiety, and stress among quarantine hotel employees in China. The mental health of quarantine hotel employees, who have faced unprecedented changes, is paramount while they provide hospitality and care for healthcare workers and quarantine guests during mandatory quarantine periods. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study that applied convenience sampling to collect questionnaire samples from 170 quarantine hotel employees in Xiamen, Fujian Province, China, during the COVID-19 pandemic, from May 20 to June 10, 2020. The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) was used to collect data. The study uses descriptive analysis, chi-square test and binary logistic regression to examine the sociodemographic factors associated with depression, anxiety and stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: The results reveal that 43.5% of respondents report moderate to extremely severe symptoms of depression; 68.2% have moderate to extremely severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.2% indicated moderate to extremely severe stress symptoms. Quarantine hotel employees who have a higher level of education are less likely to experience anxiety, and those with higher incomes are less likely to experience depression. DISCUSSION: In order to mitigate the increasing levels of anxiety and depression among their staff, quarantine hoteliers or managers urgently need to implement mental health assistance programs, such as providing extra training in hygiene and knowledge about COVID-19, offering online counseling and psychological support services, training in positive thinking, encouraging staff to keep in touch with their personal support networks, and constructing a resilience model."

392,10092020098339,"To investigate chemical characteristics, abatement mechanisms and regional transport of atmospheric pollutants during the COVID-19 outbreak control period in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, China, the measurements of air pollutants including fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on non-control period (NCP, 24 December, 2019–23 January, 2020) and control period (CP, 24 January–23 February, 2020) were analyzed at the urban Pudong Supersite (PD) and the regional Dianshan Lake Supersite (DSL). Due to the stricter outbreak control, the levels of PM(2.5) and VOCs, and the occurrence frequencies of haze-fog episodes decreased substantially from NCP to CP, with average reduction rates of 31.6%, 38.9% and 35.1% at PD, and 34.5%, 50.7% and 37.9% at DSL, respectively. The major source for PM(2.5) was secondary sulfate & nitrate in both periods, and the emission control of primary sources such as coal burning and vehicle exhaust decreased the levels of precursors gas sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, which highly contributed to the abatement of PM(2.5) from NCP to CP. The higher levels of ozone at both PD and DSL on CP might be due to the weak nitrogen monoxide titration, low relative humidity and high visibility compared with NCP. Vehicle exhaust and fugitive emission from petrochemical industry were the major contributors of ambient VOCs and their decreasing activities mainly accounted for VOCs abatement. Moreover, the high frequency of haze-fog events was closely impacted by medium-scale regional transport within Anhui and Jiangsu provinces. Therefore, the decreasing regional transported air pollutants coincided with the emission control of local sources to cause the abatement of haze-fog events in YRD region on CP. This study could improve the understanding of the change of atmospheric pollutants during the outbreak control period, and provide scientific base for haze-fog pollution control in YRD region, China."
393,10042020046817,"Severe infection involving the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome that subsequently requires patients to be intubated and dependent on mechanical ventilation. In the setting of the recent pandemic, there is a greater need to perform tracheostomy for these patients. With the high transmissibility of the virus, there has been an increasing concern for the development of techniques to perform surgical intervention while mitigating the risk for infecting hospital staff. As more data emerge pertaining to viral shedding in various bodily fluids, it has become more important to give special attention to precautions. In this article, we submit a novel approach for better protection and thus reduced transmission for tracheostomy in a COVID-19 positive patient. Importantly, this technique is functional, easy to set up, and can be used for additional operations that involve risk of aerosolization or droplet exposure to operating room staff."
394,10072020070807,"This chapter presents a conceptual framework and setting for the book. This is informed by the desire to link three critical thematic areas, namely, (i) the global tourism value chains, (ii) COVID-19 and (iii) the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (AfSD) and the 17 embedded sustainable development goals (SDGs). Bringing in the SDGs adds value given that there are three SDGs (SDGs 8, 12 and 14) that make specific reference to tourism. Furthermore, COVID-19 negatively impacted many SDGs leading to governments, civic and private organisations revising budgets to channel resources towards “flattening” both the COVID-19 and economic curves. Understanding the global tourism value chains assists in opening up the complex tourism space and to systematically document COVID-19 impacts along with the industries within the value chain nodes. To this end, this chapter comes across mainly as an essay with heavy dependence on value add from the document and critical discourse analysis, as well as a meta-analysis of secondary data sources. The chapter is useful from both a theoretical and practical application points of view. A section bringing the nexus of the thematic focus areas is slotted in towards the end, with a critique of how the tourism sector should address shortfalls in relation to the SDGs within the COVID-19 pandemic."
395,10142021023030,"Purpose: SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause the coronavirus disease (COVID), ranging from flu-like symptoms to interstitial pneumonia. Mortality is high in COVID pneumonia and it is the highest among the frailest. COVID could be particularly serious in patients with severe acquired brain injury (SABI), such as those with a disorder of consciousness. We here describe a cohort of patients with a disorder of consciousness exposed to SARS-CoV-2 early after their SABI. Materials and methods: The full cohort of 11 patients with SABI hospitalized in March 2020 in the IRCCS Fondazione Don Gnocchi rehabilitation (Milan, Italy) was recruited. Participants received SARS-CoV-2 testing and different clinical and laboratory data were collected. Results: Six patients contracted SARS-CoV-2 and four of them developed the COVID. Of these, one patient had ground-glass opacities on the chest CT scan, while the remaining three developed consolidations. No patient died and the overall respiratory involvement was mild, requiring in the worst cases low-flow oxygen. Conclusions: Here we report the clinical course of a cohort of patients with SABI exposed to SARS-CoV-2. The infection spread among patients and caused COVID in some of them. Unexpectedly, COVID was moderate, caused at most mild respiratory distress and did not result in fatalities."
396,10062020064673,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: An unexpected and sudden outbreak of a novel infection known as a coronavirus (COVID-19) has imposed important problems to global well-being and economy. Based upon current researches, this virus is spreading from one human to another through respiratory droplets, i.e. cough and sneeze. Till now, there has not been any specific treatment found for this virus. Hence, there is a critical need to discover alternative techniques to cope with the current scenario. RECENT FINDINGS: This review conducted an online search for prevention of coronavirus infection with the help of nutritional interventions. It has been observed that the effect of the virus is mostly on the individual with low immunity, individual affected with diseases like diabetes, and individual using any immune-suppressed drug or having past history of major surgeries or severe medical conditions. SUMMARY: Therefore, consuming foods which boost immunity helps in preventing respiratory-related disorder or suppressing diseases-related problems, which could be helpful in controlling the spread of this virus. In conclusion, it has been suggested that before the beginning of generalised treatments and interventions in each infected patient, nutritional status should be evaluated, as it can help in creating a specific nutrition intervention for the infected individual."
397,10122020123273,"This research was done during the DOMath program at Duke University from May 18 to July 10, 2020. At the time, Duke and other universities across the country were wrestling with the question of how to safely welcome students back to campus in the Fall. Because of this, our project focused on using mathematical models to evaluate strategies to suppress the spread of the virus on campus, specifically in dorms and in classrooms. For dorms, we show that giving students single rooms rather than double rooms can substantially reduce virus spread. For classrooms, we show that moving classes with size above some cutoff online can make the basic reproduction number $ R_0 < 1 $, preventing a wide spread epidemic. The cutoff will depend on the contagiousness of the disease in classrooms."
398,101720210510324,"OBJECTIVE To assess the safety of the Sputnik V (Gam-COVID-Vac) COVID-19 vaccine through participant-based active surveillance from the Republic of San Marino vaccination campaign. DESIGN AND SETTING This is a nation-wide cohort study in the Republic of San Marino to monitor any Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) with the Sputnik V. PARTICIPANTS Adults aged 18-89 years who had at least one dose of Sputnik V administered and who responded or accessed to an e-questionnaire sent via email, QR-code or were live/phone interviewed about the 7 days after the first vaccine dose (n=2,558) and 7 days after the second dose (n=1,288). Exclusion criteria were inability to understand nor to answer the questionnaire properly. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Rates of overall AEFI short-term and long-term (3 months). Secondary outcomes focus on subgroups of the population presenting specific comorbidities. Being this an interim analysis, long-term data (3 months) is still being collected, especially for vulnerable populations, including subjects with comorbidities and the youngest age groups. RESULT The median age of participants was 68 years. 56% were females. After the first dose, vaccine recipients described both local and systemic reactions in 16.4% of cases, 25.8% reported systemic reactions only, and 10.2% reported local symptoms only. After the second dose, both local and systemic reactions were reported in 31.9% of cases, 18.5% reported systemic reactions only, and 16.1% reported local symptoms only. Main symptoms were local pain (24.8% for first dose and 43.8% for the second), asthenia (23.8% and 31.9%), headache (18.5% and 21.0%), and joint pain (16.5% and 21.9%). In the population over 60, recipients having reported AEFI after the first dose could be a predictor of AEFI recurrence after the second dose (p<0.001). 81.8% of those reporting second-dose AEFI, reported AEFI after the first dose, while amongst those not having reported any AEFI after the first dose, 18.2% reported AEFI after the second dose. CONCLUSION The ROCCA interim analysis confirmed a good tolerability profile in the over 60 years age group after both doses regarding short-term solicited AEFI to Sputnik V (Gam-COVID-Vac)."
399,10112020115263,"OBJECTIVE: to analyze the newspaper articles on hospital care for elderly COVID-19 patients in online newspapers. METHOD: documentary, retrospective, descriptive and exploratory research. The data were collected from articles published on open-access websites of 12 newspapers from the following countries: Brazil, Spain, United States, France, Italy and Portugal. RESULTS: out of 4,220 newspaper articles identified in this regard, 101 were selected after applying the inclusion criteria, the majority coming from Italy. The data analysis revealed three thematic categories: the care for patients with COVID-19 in the health system; the work process of the health team and its concern with contagion; and ethical dilemma in care for the elderly during hospitalization. CONCLUSION: the COVID-19 pandemic presented itself quickly and was widely reported in all countries. The health systems need to reorganize for care to the global population, especially the elderly, considering their weaknesses and also the lack of prior professional training to offer care to this population."
400,101520210311398,"The COVID-19 pandemic has strained health care systems around the world. Pharmacists have made substantial contributions to the health care operations during the COVID-19 response. The Pharmacy Department at Qatar Primary Health Care Corporation (PHCC) acted proactively to ensure that all patients received their medications and their refilled prescriptions in time and without any disruption. The Medication Home Delivery Service was introduced and implemented for all Qatar residents to prevent unnecessary visits to health centers, minimize the spread of COVID-19 to vulnerable populations, especially those with multiple comorbidities, and protect health care workers from exposure to the virus. Moreover, several other precautionary measures were taken by the PHCC to ensure uninterrupted access to health care, including moving to a virtual health care delivery model. As of September 2020, the service had served around 64,213 patients since its launch in March 2020. In total, 70,357 medications were delivered and 69,092 (98.2%) medication packages were delivered successfully to patients, with an average of 450.8 medication packages delivered per month. Despite various challenges, the PHCC is considering continuing the Medication Home Delivery Service in the long term to continue with a more effective and efficient service for patients during the coming months and years."

402,10092020090765,"BACKGROUND: The excessive amount of information (infodemic) about SARS-COV2 is a global challenge for healthcare authorities in tackling misinformation. Aim of the study was to investigate SARS-COV2 global and Italian web search amount made through a reliable information source during 2019-20 SARS-COV2 epidemic. METHODS: From December 15th, 2019 to February 23rd, 2020, we used Google Trends to analyze global changes in the volume of searches about “Coronavirus” in relation to reliable sources: “World Health Organization”, “WHO” and the Italian equivalents of “Ministry of Health” and “National Institute of Health”. Primary searches and associated queries (AQs) were analyzed by nation and Italian Region. RESULTS: Global interest on “Coronavirus” progressively rose from mid-January, with 2 peaks on days 28th and 31st, fell on February 20th and rose again until day 23rd. “WHO” searches fluctuated with no clear pattern but increased on January 26th and February 3rd. 'WHO' term was among the most frequent “Coronavirus” AQs and viceversa. Singapore, Italy and New Zealand were the most interested nations in “Coronavirus”, while China was at first place in “Coronavirus+WHO” searches. In Italy from January 21st interest in “Coronavirus” gradually increased, with peaks on days 28th and 31st and a higher peak on February 21st. The other terms showed a fluctuating trend, with peaks on January 31st for “WHO” and “Ministry of Health” and on February 21st for all of them. “Coronavirus” was most frequently AQ to “Italy” and “China”, while AQs for the other terms were “Coronavirus” and “WHO official website”. The most interested Italian Regions for “Coronavirus” and “Coronavirus+WHO” were Lazio and Friuli Venezia-Giulia, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Interest in SARS-COV2 globally increased during the considered period, especially within most affected areas. The associations between terms thus highlighted seems to confirm that the general population relies on trustworthy information sources. KEY MESSAGES: Infodemic can be at the same time a danger and an opportunity during global and local health emergencies. Health systems should take advantage of current search flow in order to foster reliable information sharing."
403,101620210411412,"Posthuman affirmative ethics relies upon a fluid, nomadic conception of the ethical subject who develops affective, material and immaterial connections to multiple others. Our purpose in this paper is to consider what posthuman affirmative business ethics would look like, and to reflect on the shift in thinking and practice this would involve. The need for a revised understanding of human–animal relations in business ethics is amplified by crises such as climate change and pandemics that are related to ecologically destructive business practices such as factory farming. In this analysis, we use feminist speculative fiction as a resource for reimagination and posthuman ethical thinking. By focusing on three ethical movements experienced by a central character named Toby in Margaret Atwood’s MaddAddam trilogy, we show how she is continually becoming through affective, embodied encounters with human and nonhuman others. In the discussion, we consider the vulnerability that arises from openness to affect which engenders heightened response-ability to and with, rather than for, multiple others. This expanded concept of subjectivity enables a more relational understanding of equality that is urgently needed in order to respond affirmatively to posthuman futures."
404,101520210310086,"Suppression of the host intracellular innate immune system is an essential aspect of viral replication. Here, we developed a suite of medium-throughput high-content cell-based assays to reveal the effect of individual coronavirus proteins on antiviral innate immune pathways. Using these assays, we screened the 196 protein products of seven coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1 and MERS). This includes a previously unidentified gene in SARS-CoV-2 encoded within the Spike gene. We observe immune-suppressing activity in both known host-suppressing genes (e.g., NSP1, Orf6, NSP3, and NSP5) as well as other coronavirus genes, including the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 protein. Moreover, the genes encoded by SARS-CoV-2 are generally more potent immune suppressors than their homologues from the other coronaviruses. This suite of pathway-based and mechanism-agnostic assays could serve as the basis for rapid in vitro prediction of the pathogenicity of novel viruses based on provision of sequence information alone."
405,10172021055404,"Strengthening the detection of second-line drug-resistance is a key tuberculosis (TB) control priority. The performance of MTBDRplus, a multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB assay is reduced when suboptimal ramp rates are used. We investigated ramp rate's effect on MTBDRsl; the most widely-used molecular second-line drug-resistant TB assay. We tested 52 smear-negative Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra-positive sputa and a Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) dilution series at manufacturer recommended (2.2 {degrees} C/s) or most common suboptimal ramp rate (4.0 {degrees} C/s; identified via an earlier survey). Mtb-complex DNA (TUB-band)-positivity, indeterminate rates, fluoroquinolone- and second-line injectable-resistance accuracy, banding differences and, separately, inter-reader variability were assessed. 39% of re-surveyed laboratories (5/13) did not use the manufacturer-recommended MTBDRsl ramp rate. On sputum, this ramp rate improved indeterminates vs. 4.0 {degrees} C/s (0/52 vs. 7/51; p=0.006), false drug-resistance calls (0/104 vs. 6/102; p=0.013), and incorrect banding calls (0/1300 vs. 55/1275; p<0.001). Valid results (neither TUB negative, indeterminate, nor any false drug-resistance calls) (52/52 vs. 41/51; p=0.001) on sputa hence improved by +21% (95% CI: 8-34%) with optimal ramp rate usage. Suboptimal ramp rate increased banding call inter-reader variability [52/1300 (4%) vs. 34/1300 (3%); p=0.030] on sputa but not dilution series; highlighting the importance of using clinical specimens for assay performance evaluations. Suboptimal ramp rate contributes to poor MTBDRsl performance. Ramp rate correction will improve second line drug-resistant TB diagnoses. Laboratories must ensure the optimal manufacturer-recommended ramp rate is used."
406,10102020107866,"In November 2019 the first cases of a novel acute respiratory syndrome has been reported in Wuhan province, China. Soon after, in January 2020 the World Health Organization declared a pandemic state due to the dissemination of a virus named SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Being an unknown disease, it is essential to assess not only its main characteristic features and overall clinical symptomatology but also its patient infection mode and propagation to design appropriate clinical interventions and treatments. In this review the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and how the virus enters the cells and activates the immune system are described. The role of three systems involved in the SARS- CoV-2 infection (renin-angiotensin, kinin and coagulation systems) is discussed with the objectives to identify and try to explain several of the events observed during the evolution of the disease and to suggest possible targets for therapeutic interventions."

408,10142021025441,"BACKGROUND: To control the spread of the new SARS-CoV-2 infection's disease (COVID-19), appropriate precautionary behaviors by the public should be promoted. There are international differences in public cognitive and behavioral pattern, attitudes toward information sources, and anxiety about COVID-19. Information about these differences could increase understanding of the patterns of epidemic-related anxiety and behavior, and would help optimize future policies for preventing the next wave of the epidemic. METHODS: To examine between-country differences in perception, attitude, and precautionary behaviors toward COVID-19, we conducted a cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire survey. Participants were adults who had been registered in Cross Marketing Group Inc. and living in the UK, Spain, or Japan. A total of 8,000 people stratified by age were recruited on a first-come, first-serve basis. Knowledge of and anxiety about COVID-19, the frequency of access and perceived credibility of several information sources, and the frequency of each precautionary behavior were examined on March 27–28, 2020, in Japan and April 17–21, 2020, in the UK and Spain. RESULTS: Knowledge, anxiety, and the frequency of precautionary behaviors were higher in the UK and Spain than in Japan. Participants with infected acquaintances were more concerned about COVID-19. However, participants in the UK rarely wore a medical mask. Participants in the UK and Spain were more eager to obtain information about COVID-19 than those in Japan. Participants in Spain tended not to trust official information and to believe specialists’ comments instead. CONCLUSION: The rapidity of the spread of COVID-19, cultural background, and recent political situations seemed to contribute to the international differences here."
409,10132021013732,"The emergence of artemisinin (ART) resistance in Plasmodium falciparum parasites, driven by K13 mutations, has led to widespread antimalarial treatment failure in Southeast Asia. In Africa, our genotyping of 3,299 isolates confirms the emergence of the K13 R561H variant in Rwanda and reveals the continuing dominance of wild-type K13 across 11 countries. We show that this mutation, along with M579I and C580Y, confers varying degrees of in vitro ART resistance in African parasites. C580Y and M579I cause substantial fitness costs, which may counter-select against their dissemination in high-transmission settings. We also define the impact of multiple K13 mutations on ART resistance and fitness in multiple Southeast Asian strains. ART susceptibility is unaltered upon editing point mutations in ferrodoxin or mdr2, earlier resistance markers. These data point to the lack of an evident biological barrier to mutant K13 mediating ART resistance in Africa, while identifying their detrimental impact on parasite growth."
410,10142021024987,"BACKGROUND: Paediatric healthcare specialists are concerned about the secondary effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on children. We report a case of acute respiratory distress in a healthy toddler whose healthcare providers were sidetracked from the correct diagnosis by suspicion of COVID-19. Case Presentation. The patient was a 20-month-old healthy boy. In the morning, he had coughed while drinking milk. He was asymptomatic for the day but presented with acute respiratory distress when lying down in the evening. An ambulance was called, and he was taken to a tertiary hospital's paediatric emergency department, where his condition and oxygen saturation fluctuated. He had mildly elevated temperature and petechiae on his trunk, showed asymmetrical radiographic and auscultatory pulmonary findings, and did not tolerate any exertion. Pneumonia was suspected, SARS-CoV-2 was considered as potential causative agent, and the child was admitted to a Paediatric Intensive Care Unit. As the patient did not show clear signs of infection or bronchial obstruction, the events were thoroughly rediscussed with the caregiver next morning. It was then found out that the child had also been eating cashew nuts. Multiple pieces of cashew nuts were removed from the left bronchial tree in a bronchoscopy. After the procedure, all symptoms promptly resolved. Foreign body aspiration—an obvious cause of acute respiratory distress in our patient's age group—was overlooked by experienced emergency medical care providers and paediatric critical care physicians due to the slightly unusual presentation, incomplete anamnestic information, and a bias to consider COVID-19 in the current exceptional circumstances. CONCLUSIONS: Emergency care providers are instructed to consider all patients with respiratory distress as potential COVID-19 patients. However, the clinical course of COVID-19 infection is usually mild in children. Therefore, alternative causes for serious breathing difficulty are more likely, and all differential diagnoses should be considered in the usual unbiased manner."

412,10092020096314,"Purpose: COVID 19 pandemic had multiple influences on the social, industrial and medical situation in all affected countries. Measures of obligatory medical confinement were suspensions of scheduled non-emergent surgical procedures and outpatients clinics as well as overall access restrictions to hospitals and medical practices. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess if the obligatory confinement (lockdown) had an effect on the number of appendectomies (during and after the period of lockdown). Methods: This retrospective study was based on anonymized nationwide administrative claims data of the German Local General Sickness Fund (AOK). Patients admitted for disease of the appendix (ICD-10: K35-K38) or abdominal and pelvic pain (ICD-10: R10) who undergone an appendectomy (OPS: 5-470) were included. The study period included six weeks of German lockdown (16.03.-26.04.2020) as well as six weeks before (03.02.-15.03.2020) and after (27.04.-07.06.2020). These periods were compared to the respective in 2019. Results: Overall number of appendectomies was significantly reduced during the lockdown time in 2020 compared to 2019. This decrease affects only appendectomies due to acute simple and non-acute appendicitis. Numbers for appendectomies in acute complex appendicitis remained unchanged. Female patients and in the age group 1-18 years showed the strongest decrease in number of cases. Conclusion: The lockdown in Germany resulted in a decreased number of appendectomies. This affected mainly appendectomies in simple acute and non-acute appendicitis, but not complicated acute appendicitis. The study gives no evidence, that the confinement measures resulted in a deterioration of medical care for appendicitis."
413,10092020099027,"SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic, displays a corona-shaped layer of spikes which play fundamental role in the infection process. Recent structural data suggest that the spikes possess orientational freedom and the ribonucleoproteins segregate into basketlike structures. How these structural features regulate the dynamic and mechanical behavior of the native virion, however, remain unknown. By imaging and mechanically manipulating individual, native SARS-CoV-2 virions with atomic force microscopy, here we show that their surface displays a dynamic brush owing to the flexibility and rapid motion of the spikes. The virions are highly compliant and able to recover from drastic mechanical perturbations. Their global structure is remarkably temperature resistant, but the virion surface becomes progressively denuded of spikes upon thermal exposure. Thus, both the infectivity and thermal sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 rely on the dynamics and the mechanics of the virus. One sentence summary The native coronavirus 2 displays a dynamic surface layer of spikes, a large mechanical compliance and unique self-healing capacity."
414,10032020031286,"Introduction: Despite numerous advances in the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms (IAs), treatment in cases of wide-neck, complex configurations or branching locations remains challenging. Apart from the paradigm shift introduced by flow diverters, several other devices have seen the light or are under development in order to address these challenges.Areas covered: We performed a review of the novel implantable endovascular devices which have been introduced for the treatment of IAs, from 1 January 2014 to 1 September 2019, excluding classic flow diverter and intracranial stent designs.Expert opinion: Alternative designs have been proposed for the treatment of IAs at branching positions, which do not jail the side branches, with or without flow diversion effect, most of which with good initial outcomes. Endosaccular devices have also been proposed, some of which with lower initial total occlusion rates. Alternative materials such as biopolymers have also been proposed and are under bench research. Despite the challenges in the exploitation of some of the new devices, most of them seem to provide solutions to some current technical shortcomings. The exploitation of the biological phenomena and the physical properties of the devices will allow us to expand the therapeutic armamentarium for more complex IA cases."
415,100720200712596,"PURPOSE: The relationship between lung ultrasound (LUS) and chest computed tomography (CT) scans in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia is not clearly defined. The primary objective of our study was to assess the performance of LUS in determining severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia compared with chest CT scan. Secondary objectives were to test the association between LUS score and location of the patient, use of mechanical ventilation, and the pulse oximetry (SpO(2))/fractional inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) ratio. METHODS: A multicentre observational study was performed between 15 March and 20 April 2020. Patients in the Emergency Department (ED) or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with acute dyspnoea who were PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2, and who had LUS and chest CT performed within a 24-h period, were included. RESULTS: One hundred patients were included. LUS score was significantly associated with pneumonia severity assessed by chest CT and clinical features. The AUC of the ROC curve of the relationship of LUS versus chest CT for the assessment of severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia was 0.78 (CI 95% 0.68–0.87; p < 0.0001). A high LUS score was associated with the use of mechanical ventilation, and with a SpO(2)/FiO(2) ratio below 357. CONCLUSION: In known SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients, the LUS score was predictive of pneumonia severity as assessed by a chest CT scan and clinical features. Within the limitations inherent to our study design, LUS can be used to assess SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia severity.

418,10062020062202,"PURPOSE Online health information (OHI) and social media have become prominent health resources for people with arthritis-related fatigue. More research is needed to understand how OHI and online social support may influence illness experiences and patient-practitioner relationships in people with arthritis-related fatigue. The present study aimed to explore how OHI and social media shape these experiences by using an inductive qualitative analysis. METHOD Seven focus groups were conducted with 21 participants aged 28-77 diagnosed with a range of rheumatic diseases. Within the focus groups, participants were asked questions about OHI, online social support and the role of OHI in their health care. The focus groups were recorded, transcribed and analysed using a combination of interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) and thematic analysis. RESULTS The analysis resulted in three themes: (a) how online social support changes illness experiences, (b) communicating fatigue to health professionals using OHI and (c) health care experiences online. These themes provide insight into the ways people with arthritis-related fatigue benefit from online social support, use OHI to support communication with health professionals and how they share health care for arthritis in online spaces. CONCLUSION This research expanded on previous literature addressing the role of OHI and social media in the illness experience of arthritis-related fatigue. As technology use is increasing, particularly in the current extraordinary environment of social distancing, it is critical to address the role of OHI and social media in health care. In this study, OHI and social media played a prevalent role in the health care of many participants."
419,10052020054212,"Currently, there is no effective antiviral drugs nor vaccine for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Due to its high conservativeness and low similarity with human genes, SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M$^{\text{pro}}$) is one of the most favorable drug targets. However, the current understanding of the molecular mechanism of M$^{\text{pro}}$ inhibition is limited by the lack of reliable binding affinity ranking and prediction of existing structures of M$^{\text{pro}}$-inhibitor complexes. This work integrates mathematics and deep learning (MathDL) to provide a reliable ranking of the binding affinities of 92 SARS-CoV-2 M$^{\text{pro}}$ inhibitor structures. We reveal that Gly143 residue in M$^{\text{pro}}$ is the most attractive site to form hydrogen bonds, followed by Cys145, Glu166, and His163. We also identify 45 targeted covalent bonding inhibitors. Validation on the PDBbind v2016 core set benchmark shows the MathDL has achieved the top performance with Pearson's correlation coefficient ($R_p$) being 0.858. Most importantly, MathDL is validated on a carefully curated SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor dataset with the averaged $R_p$ as high as 0.751, which endows the reliability of the present binding affinity prediction. The present binding affinity ranking, interaction analysis, and fragment decomposition offer a foundation for future drug discovery efforts."
420,10112020113612,"BACKGROUND Otitis media with effusion is the major cause of acquired hearing problems in children. Some of the affected children need surgery with ventilation tubes in the tympanic membrane to reduce ear complaints and to improve hearing, middle ear function, and health-related quality of life. This is one of the most common ambulatory surgeries performed on children. Postoperative controls are needed to assess that the tubes are functional, to evaluate whether hearing loss has been improved, and to handle potential complications. The follow-up may continue for years and are usually done by otolaryngologists. Nevertheless, there exist no evidence-based guidelines concerning the level of expertise needed for postoperative controls of the ventilation tubes. The aim of this protocol is to describe the ConVenTu study that evaluates whether postoperative controls performed by general practitioners (GPs) represent a safe and sufficient alternative to controls performed by otolaryngologists. METHODS/DESIGN Multicenter randomized non-inferiority study conducted in clinical settings in seven hospitals located in Norway. Discharged children with ventilation tubes, aged 3-10 years, are allocated randomly to receive postoperative controls by either an otolaryngologist at the hospital where they had ventilation tube surgery or their regular GP. Study participants are enrolled consecutively until 200 patients are included in each group. Two years after surgery, we will compare the pure tone average of hearing thresholds (primary endpoint) and middle ear function, complication rate, health-related quality of life and the parents' evaluations of the postoperative care (secondary endpoints). DISCUSSION This protocol describes the first randomized non-inferiority study of GPs performing postoperative controls after surgery with ventilation tubes. Results from this study may be utilized for deriving evidence-based clinical practice guidelines of the level of postoperative controls after ventilation tube surgery which is safe and sufficient.

422,10102020109693,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has affected people’s health worldwide. For college students, web-based physical education is a challenge, as these course are normally offered outdoors. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to use data from a web-based survey to evaluate the relationship between the mental health status of college students and their sports-related lifestyles. Problems related to web-based physical education were also examined. METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted by snowball sampling from May 8 to 11, 2020. Demographic data, mental health status, and sports-related lifestyles of college students in Wuhan as well as issues related to web-based physical education were collected. Mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). RESULTS: The study included 1607 respondents from 267 cities. The average scores of the DASS-21 subscales (2.46 for depression, 1.48 for anxiety, and 2.59 for stress) were significantly lower in our study than in a previous study (P<.05). Lower DASS-21 scores were significantly correlated with regular exercise, maintaining exercise habits during the outbreak of COVID-19, exercising more than 1 to 2 times a week, exercise duration >1 hour, and >2000 pedometer steps (all P<.05). None of the three forms of web-based physical education was preferred by more than 50% of respondents. Frequent technical problems were confronted by 1087/1607 students (67.6%). Shape-up exercises (846/1607, 52.6%), a designed combination of exercises (710/1607, 44.2%), and Chinese kung fu (559/1607, 34.8%) were suggested sports for web-based physical education. CONCLUSIONS: Mental status was significantly correlated with regular exercise and sufficient exercise duration. Professional physical guidance is needed for college students in selected sports. Exercises not meeting students’ preferences, frequent technical problems, and the distant interaction involved in web-based physical education were the main problems that should be solved in future."
423,10172021051662,"Background and Aims: The clinical adverse events of COVID-19 among clergy worldwide have been found to be higher than among ordinary communities, probably because of the nature of their work. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of cardiac risk factors on COVID-19-related mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation in Coptic clergy. Methods: Of 1570 Coptic clergy participating in the COVID-19-Clergy study, serving in Egypt, USA and Europe, 213 had the infection and were included in this analysis. Based on the presence of systemic arterial hypertension (AH), participants were divided into two groups: Group-I, clergy with AH (n = 77) and Group-II, without AH (n = 136). Participants’ demographic indices, cardiovascular risk factors, COVID-19 management details and related mortality were assessed. Results: Clergy with AH were older (p < 0.001), more obese (p = 0.04), had frequent type 2 diabetes (DM) (p = 0.001), dyslipidemia (p = 0.001) and coronary heart disease (CHD) (p = 0.04) compared to those without AH. COVID-19 treatment at home, hospital or in intensive care did not differ between the patient groups (p > 0.05 for all). Clergy serving in Northern and Southern Egypt had a higher mortality rate compared to those from Europe and the USA combined (5.22%, 6.38%, 0%; p = 0.001). The impact of AH on mortality was significant only in Southern Egypt (10% vs. 3.7%; p = 0.01) but not in Northern Egypt (4.88% vs. 5.81%; p = 0.43). In multivariate analysis, CHD OR 1.607 ((0.982 to 3.051); p = 0.02) and obesity, OR 3.403 ((1.902 to 4.694); p = 0.04) predicted COVID-19 related mortality. A model combining cardiac risk factors (systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 160 mmHg, DM, obesity and history of CHD) was the most powerful independent predictor of COVID-19-related mortality, OR 3.991 ((1.919 to 6.844); p = 0.002). Almost the same model also proved the best independent multivariate predictor of mechanical ventilation OR 1.501 ((0.809 to 6.108); p = 0.001). Conclusion: In Coptic clergy, the cumulative impact of risk factors was the most powerful predictor of mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation."
424,100920200912770,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Influenza type A virus infections are still one of the major concerns for the health of humans and various species of domestic and companion animals. Wild birds play an essential role in the transmission cycle of the virus. Regularly monitoring the spread of the virus is a significant step in its mitigation. Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, including H5N1 and H5N8, have been reported in birds in the Arabian Peninsula, including Saudi Arabia, in recent decades. This study aimed to evaluate the immune status of birds, domestic and companion animals for Influenza type A virus in Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected 195 serum samples from dromedary camels, sheep, goats, native breed chickens, doves, dogs, and cats. We tested these sera for the presence of specific antibodies against influenza type A virus using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Our results show that 4% of the tested samples had antibodies in sera, including some doves, chickens, and dogs. These data suggest exposure and seroconversion of these animals or birds to the influenza type A virus. CONCLUSION: The presence of antibodies against influenza type A virus in sera of some animals and birds without a previous vaccination history against the virus indicates a natural exposure history regarding this virus and seroconversion. Further large-scale molecular and epidemiological studies are needed to obtain a better understanding of the dynamics of influenza type A virus among various species of animals and birds."

However, the reliability of these variables has not been determined. RESEARCH AIMS To test the (i) interrater and intrarater reliability of intra-mammary width measurement and interrater reliability of categorizing women's breasts into breast types, and (ii) feasibility and acceptability of study procedures for the participants. METHODS This was a prospective, longitudinal, non-experimental design with survey and observational components of a convenience sample of early postpartum women (N = 31). Interrater and intrarater reliability were measured using intraclass correlation coefficient for agreement for intra-mammary width measurements. Interrater reliability was measured using weighted kappa for agreement for categorizing breast type. Feasibility and acceptability of study procedures were collected 1 month later. RESULTS Excellent intrarater and interrater reliability for the intra-mammary width measurement (ICC = 0.99, 95% CI [0.99, 0.997] and ICC = 0.88, 95% CI [0.74, 0.94], respectively) and fair interrater reliability for breast type categorization (k = 0.35, 95% CI [-0.05, 0.75]) with high level of agreement between raters (97%) were achieved. Proportions of participants agreeing to breast photography and acceptability of study procedures were 68% (21/31) and 100% (28/28) respectively. CONCLUSION The excellent reliability for the intra-mammary width measurement means it provides a useful measure for future research. Since the ""fair"" reliability of categorizing breast type was due to lack of breast shape range in our sample, future research could assess the breasts of women with different medical profiles."

428,101520210312849,"BACKGROUND. The Nepalese government announced a nationwide lockdown beginning on March 24, 2020 as an attempt to restrain the spread of COVID-19. The prohibition in flight operations and movement of vehicles, factory shutdowns and restriction in people's movement due to the lockdown led to a significant reduction in the amounts of pollutants degrading air quality in many countries. OBJECTIVES. The present study aimed to analyze changes in particulate matter (PM) emissions and the air quality index (AQI) of six cities in Nepal i.e., Damak, Simara, Kathmandu, Pokhara, Nepalgunj and Surkhet due to the nationwide lockdown in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS. Daily PM concentrations of each of the six study cities from January 24 to September 21, 2020 were obtained from the World Air Quality Index project (https://aqicn.org) and analyzed using R Studio software. The drop percentage was calculated to determine the change in PM(2.5) and PM(10) concentration during different time periods. Independent sample Mann–Whitney U tests were performed to test the significance of differences in mean concentration for each site during the lockdown period (24 March–24 July 2020) and its corresponding period in 2019. Similarly, the significance of differences in mean concentrations between the lockdown period and the period immediately before lockdown (23 January–23 March) was also examined using the same test. RESULTS. During the lockdown period, in overall Nepal, AQI(PM2.5) and AQI(PM10) were within the moderate zone for the maximum number of days. As a result of the lockdown, the highest immediate and final drop of PM(2.5) was observed in Damak (26.37%) and Nepalgunj (80.86%), respectively. Similarly, the highest immediate drop of PM(10) was observed in Surkhet (37.22%) and finally in Nepalgunj (81.14%). Analysis with the Mann–Whitney U test indicated that for both PM types, all sites showed a statistically significant (p < 0.05) difference in mean concentrations during lockdown and the corresponding period in 2019. CONCLUSIONS. The present study explored the positive association between vehicular movement and PM emissions, highlighting the need for alternative fuel sources to improve air quality and human health.

429,10132021017554,"The rapid outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has demonstrated the need for development of new vaccine candidates and therapeutic drugs to fight against the underlying virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Currently, no antiviral treatment is available to treat COVID-19 as treatment is mostly directed to only relieving the symptoms. Retrospectively, herbal medicinal plants have been used for thousands of years as a medicinal alternative including for the treatment of various viral illnesses. However, a comprehensive description using various medicinal plants in treating coronavirus infection has not to date been described adequately, especially their modes of action. Most other reports and reviews have also only focused on selected ethnobotanical herbs such as Traditional Chinese Medicine, yet more plants can be considered to enrich the source of the anti-viral compounds. In this review, we have screened and identified potential herbal medicinal plants as anti-coronavirus medication across major literature databases without being limited to any regions or ethnobotanic criteria. As such we have successfully gathered experimentally validated in vivo, in vitro, or in silico findings of more than 30 plants in which these plant extracts or their related compounds, such as those of Artemisia annua L., Houttuynia cordata Thunb., and Sambucus formosana Nakai, are described through their respective modes of action against specific mechanisms or pathways during the viral infection. This includes inhibition of viral attachment and penetration, inhibition of viral RNA and protein synthesis, inhibition of viral key proteins such as 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CL(pro)) and papain-like protease 2 (PL(pro)), as well as other mechanisms including inhibition of the viral release and enhanced host immunity. We hope this compilation will help researchers and clinicians to identify the source of appropriate anti-viral drugs from plants in combating COVID-19 and, ultimately, save millions of affected human lives."
430,101020201013171,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already caused hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide in a few months. Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes and chronic lung disease have been identified as the main COVID-19 comorbidities. Moreover, despite similar infection rates between men and women, the most severe course of the disease is higher in elderly and co-morbid male patients. Therefore, the occurrence of specific comorbidities associated with renin–angiotensin system (RAS) imbalance mediated by the interaction between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and desintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 17 (ADAM17), along with specific genetic factors mainly associated with type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) expression, could be decisive for the clinical outcome of COVID-19. Indeed, the exacerbated ADAM17—mediated ACE2, TNF-α, and IL-6R secretion emerges as a possible underlying mechanism for the acute inflammatory immune response and the activation of the coagulation cascade. Therefore, in this review, we focus on the main pathophysiological aspects of ACE2, ADAM17, and TMPRSS2 host proteins in COVID-19. Additionally, we discuss a possible mechanism to explain the deleterious effect of ADAM17 and TMPRSS2 over-activation in the COVID-19 outcome."
431,100820200813046,"The aim of this study is to examine the use of an inflammasome competitor as a preventative agent. Coronaviruses have zoonotic potential due to the adaptability of their S protein to bind receptors of other species, most notably demonstrated by SARS-CoV. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to TLR (Toll-like receptor) causes the release of pro-IL-1β, which is cleaved by caspase-1, followed by the formation and activation of the inflammasome, which is a mediator of lung inflammation, fever, and fibrosis. The NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3) inflammasome is implicated in a variety of human diseases including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), prion diseases, type 2 diabetes, and numerous infectious diseases. By examining the use of 4,4′-diaminodiphenyl sulfone (DDS) in the treatment of patients with Hansen’s disease, also diagnosed as Alzheimer’s disease, this study demonstrates the diverse mechanisms involved in the activation of inflammasomes. TLRs, due to genetic polymorphisms, can alter the immune response to a wide variety of microbial ligands, including viruses. In particular, TLR2Arg(677)Trp was reported to be exclusively present in Korean patients with lepromatous leprosy (LL). Previously, mutation of the intracellular domain of TLR2 has demonstrated its role in determining the susceptibility to LL, though LL was successfully treated using a combination of DDS with rifampicin and clofazimine. Of the three tested antibiotics, DDS was effective in the molecular regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activators that are important in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and AD. The specific targeting of NLRP3 itself or up-/downstream factors of the NLRP3 inflammasome by DDS may be responsible for its observed preventive effects, functioning as a competitor."

Method We modelled changes in time use and social mixing based on age-stratified contact rates using historical nationally-representative surveys and up-to-date Google mobility data from four weeks before and after the festive period. We explored changes in the effective reproduction number and the age distribution of cases, in four scenarios: (1) ""normal"": time use and contact patterns as observed historically, (2) ""pre-lockdown"": patterns as seen before the lockdown in November 2020, (3) ""lockdown"": patterns restricted as in November 2020, and (4) ""festive break"": similar to 3 but with social visits over the holiday period as in 1. Results Across ages, the estimated Reff decreases during the festive break in scenarios 1-3 and returns to pre-holiday levels in scenarios 2-3, while remaining relatively stable in scenario 4. Relative incidence is likely to decrease in children aged 0-15 but increase in other ages. Changes in age distribution were large during the holidays, and are likely to start before the holidays for individuals aged 16-24 years in scenarios 1-3. Conclusions Our modelling findings suggest that increased contacts during the festive period may shift the age distribution of COVID-19 cases from children towards adults. Given that COVID-19-related hospitalisations and deaths rise by age, more intergenerational mixing risks an increased burden in the period following the holidays."
433,10052020058428,"Since the outbreak of SARS‐CoV‐2 in December 2019, the etiology of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19) has spread to most of the world within months. The understanding of pathomechanism of SARS‐CoV‐2 is extremely limited."
434,10112020118747,"BACKGROUND: In late March 2020, a “Stay Home, Stay Healthy” order was issued in Washington State in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On May 1, a 4-phase reopening plan began. We investigated whether adjunctive prevention strategies would allow less restrictive physical distancing to avoid second epidemic waves and secure safe school reopening. METHODS: We developed a mathematical model, stratifying the population by age, infection status and treatment status to project SARS-CoV-2 transmission during and after the reopening period. The model was parameterized with demographic and contact data from King County, WA and calibrated to confirmed cases, deaths and epidemic peak timing. Adjunctive prevention interventions were simulated assuming different levels of pre-COVID physical interactions (pC_PI) restored. RESULTS: The best model fit estimated ~35% pC_PI under the lockdown which prevented ~17,000 deaths by May 15. Gradually restoring 75% pC_PI for all age groups between May 15-July 15 would have resulted in ~350 daily deaths by early September 2020. Maintaining <45% pC_PI was required with current testing practices to ensure low levels of daily infections and deaths. Increased testing, isolation of symptomatic infections, and contact tracing permitted 60% pC_PI without significant increases in daily deaths before November and allowed opening of schools with <15 daily deaths. Inpatient antiviral treatment was predicted to reduce deaths significantly without lowering cases or hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: We predict that widespread testing, contact tracing and case isolation would allow relaxation of physical distancing, as well as opening of schools, without a surge in local cases and deaths."
435,10082020081869,"The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has been a global concern since early 2020, where the number of COVID-19 cases is also on a rapid surge in Bangladesh with the report of a total of 276,549 cases after the detection of the first three cases in this country on 8 March 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has made a seismic shift in the healthcare delivery system, where physician offices have accelerated digital health solutions at record speed, putting telemedicine (i.e., telehealth) at centre stage. Amid the severely contagious COVID-19, telemedicine has moved from being an optional service to an essential one. As the developing country, there are some barriers to get evenly distributed advantages of this approach due to the digital divides and disparities. In this commentary, we have described the importance of telemedicine service amid the outbreak of COVID-19 in Bangladesh, the barriers and challenges that the country is facing to implement this approach and the strategies to overcome these barriers in this developing country."
436,10062020069357,"Media reports can modify people’s knowledge of emerging infectious diseases, and thus changing the public attitudes and behaviors. However, how the media reports affect the development of COVID-19 epidemic is a key public health issue. Here the Pearson correlation and cross-correlation analyses are conducted to find the statistically significant correlations between the number of new hospital notifications for COVID-19 and the number of daily news items for twelve major websites in China from January 11th to February 6th 2020. To examine the implication for transmission dynamics of these correlations, we proposed a novel model, which embeds the function of individual behaviour change (media impact) into the intensity of infection. The nonlinear least squares estimation is used to identify the best-fit parameter values in the model from the observed data. To determine impact of key parameters with media impact and control measures for the later outcome of the outbreak, we also carried out the uncertainty and sensitivity analyses. These findings confirm the importance of the responses of individuals to the media reports, and the crucial role of experts and governments in promoting the public under self-quarantine. Therefore, for mitigating epidemic COVID-19, the media publicity should be focused on how to guide people’s behavioral changes by experts, and the management departments and designated hospitals of the COVID-19 should take effective quarantined measures, which are critical for the control of the disease."
437,10092020092172,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide and caused widespread devastation. In the absence of definitive therapy, symptomatic management remains the standard of care. Repurposing of many existing drugs including several anti-viral drugs is being attempted to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. However, most of them have failed to show significant benefit in clinical trials. An attractive approach may be to target host proteases involved in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. The priming of the spike (S) protein of the virus by proteolytic cleavage by the trans-membrane serine protease-2 (TMPRSS2) is necessary for fusion of the virus to the host cell after it binds to its receptor angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). There are other proteases with varying spatiotemporal locations that may be important for viral entry and subsequent replication inside the cells, and these include trypsin, furin and cathepsins. In this report, we discuss the tentative therapeutic role of inhibitors of TMPRSS2, cathepsin, trypsin, furin, plasmin, factor X and elastase in infection caused by SARS-CoV-2. Both available evidence as well as hypotheses are discussed, with emphasis on drugs which are approved for other indications such as bromhexine, ammonium chloride, nafamostat, camostat, tranexamic acid, epsilon amino-caproic acid, chloroquine, ulinastatin, aprotinin and anticoagulant drugs. Simultaneously, novel compounds being tested and problems with using these agents are also discussed."
438,10022020020352,"BACKGROUND There has been increasing evidence and debate on palliative care research priorities and the international research agenda. To date, however, there is a lack of synthesis of this evidence, examining commonalities, differences, and gaps. To identify and synthesize literature on international palliative care research priorities originating from Western countries mapped to a quality assessment framework. METHODS A systematic review of several academic and grey databases were searched from January 2008-June 2019 for studies eliciting research priorities in palliative care in English. Two researchers independently reviewed, critically appraised, and conducted data extraction and synthesis. RESULTS The search yielded 10,235 articles (academic databases, n = 4108; grey literature, n = 6127), of which ten were included for appraisal and review. Priority areas were identified: service models; continuity of care; training and education; inequality; communication; living well and independently; and recognising family/carer needs and the importance of families. Methodological approaches and process of reporting varied. There was little representation of patient and caregiver driven agendas. The priorities were mapped to the Donabedian framework for assessing quality reflecting structure, process and outcomes and key priority areas. CONCLUSIONS Limited evidence exists pertaining to research priorities across palliative care. Whilst a broad range of topics were elicited, approaches and samples varied questioning the credibility of findings. The voice of the care provider dominated, calling for more inclusive means to capture the patient and family voice. The findings of this study may serve as a template to understand the commonalities of research, identify gaps, and extend the palliative care research agenda."
439,10162021045816,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) share a target receptor with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The use of ACEIs/ARBs may cause angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor upregulation, facilitating the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells. There is concern that the use of ACEIs/ARBs could increase the risks of severe COVID-19 and mortality. The impact of discontinuing these drugs in patients with COVID-19 remains uncertain. We aimed to assess the association between the use of ACEIs/ARBs and the risks of mortality and severe disease in patients with COVID-19. A systematic search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and MedRxiv.org from December 1, 2019, to June 20, 2020. We also identified additional citations by manually searching the reference lists of eligible articles. Forty-two observational studies including 63,893 participants were included. We found that the use of ACEIs/ARBs was not significantly associated with a reduction in the relative risk of all-cause mortality [odds ratio (OR) = 0.87, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.75–1.00; I(2) = 57%, p = 0.05]. We found no significant reduction in the risk of severe disease in the ACEI subgroup (OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.88–1.02, I(2) = 50%, p = 0.18), the ARB subgroup (OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.94–1.13, I(2) = 62%, p = 0.48), or the ACEI/ARB subgroup (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.65–1.08, I(2) = 67%, p = 0.16). Moreover, seven studies showed no significant difference in the duration of hospitalization between the two groups (mean difference = 0.33, 95% CI = −1.75 to 2.40, p = 0.76). In conclusion, the use of ACEIs/ARBs appears to not have a significant effect on mortality, disease severity, or duration of hospitalization in COVID-19 patients. On the basis of the findings of this meta-analysis, there is no support for the cessation of treatment with ACEIs or ARBs in patients with COVID-19."
440,10142021026148,"BACKGROUND: There is a need for interventions to foster and maintain independence for people with dementia to support community living, improve morale, and reduce stigma. We investigated a social intervention to promote living well and enhance independence for people with mild dementia. METHODS: In this two arm parallel group, feasibility RCT at six sites in England, participants were randomized (1:1) to the PRIDE intervention (encompassing social, physical, and cognitive domains supported by a facilitator over three sessions) compared to usual care only. The main objective was to determine the feasibility of a main trial with respect to measures of recruitment, retention, and adherence to the intervention. RESULTS: During a 7-month period, 402 people were invited to the trial, 148 were screened (37%, 95% confidence interval (CI)=32–42%), 137 were eligible at pre-consent, 94 consented to the trial (69% of those eligible, 95% CI=60–76%), and 92 were randomized (46 to each group). Of those allocated to the intervention, 42 (91%) received at least one of three intervention sessions. Outcome assessment follow-up visits were completed for 73 participants at 6 months (79%, 95% CI=70–87%), and this was similar for both groups. CONCLUSION: A large multi-center trial of the PRIDE intervention in community-dwelling people with mild dementia is feasible using systematic recruitment strategies. The intervention was successfully delivered and well received by participants. Findings from this study will be used to refine the design and processes for a definitive RCT. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN, ISRCTN11288961, registered on 23 October 2018."
441,10062020066064,"At the time of writing, the COVID-19 infection is spreading rapidly. Currently, there is no vaccine or treatment, and researchers around the world are attempting to fight the infection. In this paper, we consider a diagnosis method for COVID-19, which is characterized by a very rapid rate of infection and is widespread. A possible method for avoiding severe infections is to stop the spread of the infection in advance by the prompt and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19. To this end, we exploit a group testing (GT) scheme, which is used to find a small set of confirmed cases out of a large population. For the accurate detection of false positives and negatives, we propose a robust algorithm (RA) based on the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP). The key idea of the proposed RA is to exploit iterative detection to propagate beliefs to neighbor nodes by exchanging marginal probabilities between input and output nodes. As a result, we show that our proposed RA provides the benefit of being robust against noise in the GT schemes. In addition, we demonstrate the performance of our proposal with a number of tests and successfully find a set of infected samples in both noiseless and noisy GT schemes with different COVID-19 incidence rates."
442,10122020121464,"Heterozygous mutations in the human SOX9 gene cause the skeletal malformation syndrome campomelic dysplasia which in 75% of 46,XY individuals is associated with male-to-female sex reversal. While studies in homozygous Sox9 knockout mouse models confirmed that SOX9 is critical for testis development, mice heterozygous for the Sox9-null allele were reported to develop normal testes. This led to the belief that the SOX9 dosage requirement for testis differentiation is different between humans, which often require both alleles, and mice, in which one allele is sufficient. However, in prior studies, gonadal phenotypes in heterozygous Sox9 XY mice were assessed only by either gross morphology, histological staining or analyzed on a mixed genetic background. In this study, we conditionally inactivated Sox9 in somatic cells of developing gonads using the Nr5a1-Cre mouse line on a pure C57BL/6 genetic background. Section and whole-mount immunofluorescence for testicular and ovarian markers showed that XY Sox9 heterozygous gonads developed as ovotestes. Quantitative droplet digital PCR confirmed a 50% reduction of Sox9 mRNA as well as partial sex reversal shown by an upregulation of ovarian genes. Our data show that haploinsufficiency of Sox9 can perturb testis development in mice, suggesting that mice may provide a more accurate model of human disorders/differences of sex development (DSD) than previously thought."
443,101220201211633,"Gram-negative bacterial infections of the testis can lead to infectious orchitis, which negatively influences steroid hormone synthesis and spermatogenesis. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major component of the Gram-negative bacterial cell wall, acts via toll like receptors 4 (TLR4) to trigger innate immune responses and activate nuclear factor kappa B signaling. The protective mechanisms of melatonin on LPS-induced infectious orchitis have not been reported. Herein, we developed an LPS-induced sheep infectious orchitis model. In this model, the phagocytic activity of testicular macrophages (TM) was enhanced after melatonin treatment. Moreover, we found that melatonin suppressed secretion of TM pro-inflammatory factors by suppressing the p38MAPK pathway and promoting Leydig cell testosterone secretion. Expressions of GTP cyclohydrolase-I and NADPH oxidase-2 were reduced by melatonin while heme oxygenase-1 expression was up-regulated. Thus, melatonin reduced the severity of LPS-induced orchitis by stimulating antioxidant activity. The results of this study provide a reference for the treatment of acute infectious orchitis."

Our approach consists of 3 steps: (1) we create an initial run with BM25 and RM3; (2) we estimate credibility and misinformation scores for the documents in the initial run; (3) we merge the relevance, credibility and misinformation scores to re-rank documents in the initial run. To estimate credibility scores, we implement a classifier which exploits features based on the content and the popularity of a document. To compute the misinformation score, we apply a stance detection approach with a pretrained Transformer language model. Finally, we use different approaches to merge scores: weighted average, the distance among score vectors and rank fusion."

446,10052020050074,"ABSTRACT: In this work, a new viral protein cage based nanoreactor was successfully constructed via encapsulating Tween 80 stabilized palladium nanoparticles (NPs) into rotavirus capsid VP2 virus-like particles (i.e. Pd@VP2). The effects of stabilizers including CTAB, SDS, Tween 80 and PVP on controlling the particle size of Pd NPs were investigated. They were further immobilized on graphene oxide (i.e. Pd@VP2/GO) by a simple mixing method. Some characterizations including FT-IR and XPS were conducted to study adsorption mode of Pd@VP2 on GO sheets. Their catalytic performance was estimated in the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP). Results showed that Tween 80 stabilized Pd NPs with the molar ratio of Pd to Tween 80 at 1:0.1 possessed the smallest size and the best stability as well. They were encapsulated into viral protein cages (mean size 49 ± 0.26 nm) to assemble confined nanoreactors, most of which contained 1–2 Pd NPs (mean size 8.15 ± 0.26 nm). As-prepared Pd@VP2 indicated an enhanced activity (apparent reaction rate constant k(app) = (3.74 ± 0.10) × 10(−3) s(−1)) for the reduction of 4-NP in comparison to non-confined Pd-Tween80 colloid (k(app) = (2.20 ± 0.06) × 10(−3) s(−1)). It was logically due to confinement effects of Pd@VP2 including high dispersion of Pd NPs and high effective concentration of substrates in confined space. Pd@VP2 were further immobilized on GO surface through C-N bond. Pd@VP2/GO exhibited good reusability after recycling for four runs, confirming the strong anchoring effects of GO on Pd@VP2.

447,10132021016892,"The use of vitamin D to reduce the severity of COVID-19 complications is receiving considerable attention, backed by encouraging data. Its purported mode of action is as an immune modulator. Vitamin D, however, also affects the metabolism of phosphate and Mg, which may well play a critical role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 may induce a cytokine storm that drains ATP whose regeneration requires phosphate and Mg. These minerals, however, are often deficient in conditions that predispose people to severe COVID-19, including older age (especially males), diabetes, obesity, and usage of diuretics. Symptoms observed in severe COVID-19 also fit well with those seen in classical hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia, such as thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, dysfunction of liver and kidneys, neurologic disturbances, immunodeficiency, failure of heart and lungs, delayed weaning from a respirator, cardiac arrhythmia, seizures, and, finally, multiorgan failure. Deficiencies of phosphate and Mg can be amplified by kidney problems commonly observed in patients with COVID-19 resulting in their wastage into urine. Available data show that phosphate and Mg are deficient in COVID-19, with phosphate showing a remarkable correlation with its severity. In one experiment, patients with COVID-19 were supplemented with a cocktail of vitamin D(3), Mg, and vitamin B(12), with very encouraging results. We, thus, argue that patients with COVID-19 should be monitored and treated for phosphate and Mg deficiencies, ideally already in the early phases of infection. Supplementation of phosphate and Mg combined with vitamin D could also be implemented as a preventative strategy in populations at risk."
448,10132021011125,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: During the recent COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine has enabled many IBD patients worldwide to get access to remote assistance. Some positive reports on the use of telemedicine among patients and healthcare providers have been published(1-4), but a patient’s trust perspective is not available yet. The aim of our study was to verify IBD patients’ trust in telemedicine. This study was approved by our local Ethics Committee. MATERIAL AND METHODS: At our Gastroenterology Unit in Milan (Italy), 123 video-consultations were delivered to IBD patients with mild or moderate disease, in place of follow-up visits scheduled but not provided during the general lockdown (March-April 2020). Video-calling solutions from Google (Hangouts or Meet) or Microsoft Teams were used according to the patient’s preference. The patients’ trust in telemedicine was assessed through an adapted version of the PAtient Trust Assessment Tool (PATAT) questionnaire.(5) The primary endpoint was expressed as a >75% percentage of patients giving a score of at least 4 out of 5 in a Likert Scale for three selected key statements: “I can trust video-consultation”, “I can trust that possible problems with the telemedicine service will be solved properly” and “I feel at ease when working with this website”. The questionnaire was formulated through the EUSurvey platform, widely used for clinical research questionnaires in Europe. RESULTS: One-hundred-fifteen (93.4%) video-consultations were performed out of the 123 scheduled. Among the 115 consultations, 100 questionnaires were completed (86.9%). The primary endpoint of trust in the telemedicine service was achieved in 95%, 90% and 84% of patients for the three selected key statements about the trust in the telemedicine service, its capability to solve clinical problems and its ease to use. While clinical outcomes were beyond our intentions, we reported no drugs withdrawal in this cohort nor major events. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that during the COVID-19 pandemic most of our IBD patients accepted to receive a video-consultation in spite of the traditional in-person visit and trusted the video-consultation.

449,10142021028165,"The telehealth revolution in response to COVID-19 has increased essential health care access during an unprecedented public health crisis. However, virtual patient care can also limit the patient-provider relationship, quality of examination, efficiency of health care delivery, and overall quality of care. As we witness the most rapidly adopted medical trend in modern history, clinicians are beginning to comprehend the many possibilities of telehealth, but its limitations also need to be understood. As outcomes are studied and federal regulations reconsidered, it is important to be precise in the virtual patient encounter approach. Herein, we offer some simple guidelines that could assist health care providers and clinic schedulers in determining the appropriateness of a telehealth visit by considering visit types, patient characteristics, and chief complaint or disease states."
450,10172021058120,"Forced strict confinement to hamper the COVID-19 pandemic seriously affected people suffering from misophonia (M+) and those living with them. Misophonia is a complex neurophysiological and behavioral disorder of multifactorial origin, characterized by an intense physiological and emotional response produced by intolerance to auditory stimuli of the same pattern, regardless of physical properties. The present work studied the secondary impact that strict confinement caused in 342 adults (224 women: 118 men) regularly attending a medical psychological center in Barcelona. Misophonia, usually underdiagnosed, showed a prevalence of 35%, the same for women (37%) than men (31%). A retrospective analysis using a physical-psychological-social inventory of 10 variables evaluated the number of individuals that during confinement and self-confinement (March 11 - June 29, 2020) canceled (mostly M-) and/or requested a therapeutic intervention, the reasons for their request, and the strategies they used to self-manage the situation. Ten main variables indicated that the confinement exponentially increased the effects of misophonia compared with results from the same individuals during the last quarter of 2019. Most people diagnosed with misophonia continued with tele-assistance during the confinement because of this impact's self-concern. Besides the impacts as part of the general population, M+ also developed different symptoms causing significant personal, social, and job/occupational imbalance, as compared to M-. Health, fears, conflicts with neighbors, study-related difficulties were outstanding reasons for consultations. The LSB-50 test for ‘Psychological and Psychosomatic Symptoms’ applied to M+ revealed the increase of 8 of 9 items of this psychopathological test. Sleep disorders (coronasomnia), hostility, depression, and somatization were more severe than in previous assessments. Women presented the worst psychological and psychosomatic states (eight out of nine, as compared to one out of nine in males). The study unveiled the complex physical-psychological-social burden, the need for dissemination and a gender perspective to understand the secondary impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of the population with misophonia. The results also show that in this new COVID era people suffering from misophonia need to develop coping strategies addressing modifiable risk and protective factors. They deserve familial/social comprehension, stronger clinical support and a gender medicine perspective."
451,10062020068049,"COVID-19 has been associated with a hypercoagulable state causing cardiovascular and neurovascular complications. To further characterize cerebrovascular disease (CVD) in COVID-19, we review the current literature of published cases and additionally report the clinical presentation, laboratory and diagnostic testing results of 12 cases with COVID-19 infection and concurrent CVD from two academic medical centers in Houston, TX, USA, between March 1 and May 10, 2020. To date, there are 12 case studies reporting 47 cases of CVD in COVID-19. However, only 4 small case series have described the clinical and laboratory findings in patients with COVID-19 and concurrent stroke. Viral neurotropism, endothelial dysfunction, coagulopathy and inflammation are plausible proposed mechanisms of CVD in COVID-19 patients. In our case series of 12 patients, 10 patients had an ischemic stroke, of which 1 suffered hemorrhagic transformation and two had intracerebral hemorrhage. Etiology was determined to be embolic without a clear cause identified in 6 ischemic stroke patients, while the remaining had an identifiable source of stroke. The majority of the patients had elevated inflammatory markers such as D-dimer and interleukin-6. In patients with embolic stroke of unclear etiology, COVID-19 may have played a direct or indirect role in the processes that eventually led to the strokes while in the remaining cases, it is unclear if infection contributed partially or was an incidental finding."
452,10032020032957,"Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first emerged in Wuhan, China, and soon caused an ongoing pandemic globally. In this study we conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combined spinal-epidural anaesthesia (CSEA) and infection control measures on perinatal care quality of 30 pregnant women with confirmed and suspected COVID-19. Methods Individual demographic data, clinical outcomes, laboratory investigations of pregnant women and their newborns were collected from electronic medical records of the Maternal and Children Health Hospital of Hubei Province, during January 24 to February 29, 2020. Anaesthesia and surgery results were compared between pregnant women with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 infection. Results Using CSEA in cesarean section was effective and safe for pregnant women with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 infection. Administration of dezocine and morphine was effective as postoperative analgesia, and well tolerated in COVID-19 patients. The assessment of surgery outcomes also showed similar results in both confirmed and suspected cases. No respiratory failure nor distress were found in the mothers with confirmed COVID-19 infection and their neonates. None of these patients experienced severe obstetric complications related to anaesthesia and surgeries. No COVID-19 infection was reported in the neonates born to the mothers with confirmed COVID-19 infection and healthcare workers in these operations. Conclusions In cesarean section for pregnant women with COVID-19 infection, CSEA was safe and efficient in achieving satisfactory obstetrical anaesthesia and postoperative analgesia. No cross-infection occurred in the HCWs working in these operations."
453,10112020119459,"Background Syndromes of iron overload have been shown to increase the risk of severe clinical disease in viral infections. Immune dysfunction is similarly described in hereditary haemochromatosis (HH). We present here the case of a 51-year-old man who developed severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) complicated by suspected haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). He was found to have HH post-mortem and we propose a link between his iron overload and the development of severe COVID-19. Case Report The initial clinical presentation consisted of cough, shortness of breath and fever. Pancytopenia, markedly elevated ferritin and d-dimer were present. Computed tomography (CT) showed bilateral ground glass changes consistent with COVID-19, widespread lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. A subsequent combined nose and throat swab was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). HLH was suspected based upon the H-score and Anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist, was commenced. Liver function acutely worsened and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) revealed hepatic haemosiderosis. Intense splenic and cervical lymph node uptake were seen on a positron emission tomography (PET) scan and high doses of intravenous steroids were administered due to concerns over haematological malignancy. Results Day fourteen of admission heralded the start of progressive clinical deterioration with rapid increase in oxygen demands. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was trialled without success and the patient unfortunately died seventeen days into admission. Results returned after his death showed homozygous C282Y mutation of the HFE gene consistent with a diagnosis of HH. Post-mortem examination revealed widespread haemosiderin deposition in the liver along with lung pathology in keeping with severe COVID-19 and widespread splenic infarctions. Conclusion An association between HH and COVID-19 is not currently described in the literature. What does exist, however, is an evidence base for the detrimental impacts iron overload has on viral infections in general and the negative effects of HH on the immune system. We therefore postulate that the underlying metabolic and immune disturbances seen in HH should be considered a potential risk factor for the development of severe COVID-19. This case also adds to the evidence that hyperinflammation appears to be a unique and interesting characteristic of this novel viral disease."
454,101520210312691,"Poor well-being amongst older adults poses a serious health concern. Simultaneously, research shows that contact with nature can improve various facets of well-being, including physical, social, and mental well-being. However, nature is not always accessible for older adults due to mobility restrictions and related care needs that come with age. A promising strategy aims at bringing nature inside through pervasive technologies. However, so far, there is little academic understanding of essential nature characteristics, psychological processes involved, and means for implementation in practice. The current study used a three-folded rapid review to assess current understanding and strategies used for improving well-being for older adults through virtual reality representations of nature. Searches were performed across three databases, followed-up by content-based evaluation of abstracts. In total, a set of 25 relevant articles was identified. Only three studies specifically focus on digital nature as an intervention strategy for improving well-being amongst older adults. Although these studies provide useful starting points for the design and (technological) development of such environments, they do not generate understanding of how specific characteristics of virtual nature representations impact social well-being measures in particular, and of the underlying psychological processes involved. We conclude that follow-up research is warranted to close the gap between insights and findings from nature research, gerontology, health research, and human-technology interaction."
455,10172021057213,"BACKGROUND: Current vaccines for the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) have demonstrated efficacy with low risk of adverse events. However, recent reports of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) associated with adenovirus vector vaccines have raised concern. OBJECTIVE: This narrative review summarizes the current background, evaluation, and management of TTS for emergency clinicians. DISCUSSION: TTS, also known as vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, is a reaction associated with exposure to the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) and AD26.COV2·S (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine, which may result in thrombocytopenia and thrombotic events. There are several case series of patients diagnosed with TTS, but the overall incidence is rare. TTS is characterized by exposure to one of the aforementioned vaccines 4–30 days prior to presentation, followed by thrombosis, mild-to-severe thrombocytopenia, and a positive platelet factor-4 (PF4)-heparin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Thrombosis typically involves atypical locations, including cerebral venous thrombosis and splanchnic vein thrombosis. Evaluation should include complete blood count, peripheral smear, D-dimer, fibrinogen, coagulation panel, renal and liver function, and electrolytes, as well as PF4-heparin ELISA if available. Consultation with hematology is recommended if suspected or confirmed. Treatment may include intravenous immunoglobulin and anticoagulation, while avoiding heparin-based agents and platelet transfusion. CONCLUSIONS: With increasing vaccine distribution, it is essential for emergency clinicians to be aware of the evaluation and management of this condition."
456,100920200914301,"BACKGROUND: Use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients lacks evidence and is still controversial. This study was designed to investigate effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) on clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients and to assess the safety of ACEIs/ARBs medication. MATERIAL/METHODS: COVID-19 patients with hypertension from 2 hospitals in Wuhan, China, from 17 Feb to 18 Mar 2020 were retrospectively screened and grouped according to in-hospital medication. We performed 1: 1 propensity score matching (PSM) analysis to adjust for confounding factors. RESULTS: We included 210 patients and allocated them to ACEIs/ARBs (n=81; 46.91% males) or non-ACEIs/ARBs (n=129; 48.06% males) groups. The median age was 68 [interquartile range (IQR) 61.5–76] and 66 (IQR 59–72.5) years, respectively. General comparison showed mortality in the ACEIs/ARBs group was higher (8.64% vs. 3.88%) but the difference was not significant (P=0.148). ACEIs/ARBs was associated with significantly more cases 7-categorical ordinal scale >2 at discharge, more cases requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay, and increased values and ratio of days that blood pressure (BP) was above normal range (P<0.05). PSM analysis showed no significant difference in mortality, cumulative survival rate, or other clinical outcomes such as length of in-hospital/ICU stay, BP fluctuations, or ratio of adverse events between groups after adjustment for confounding parameters on admission. CONCLUSIONS: We found no association between ACEIs/ARBs and clinical outcomes or adverse events, thus indicating no evidence for discontinuing use of ACEIs/ARBs in the COVID-19 pandemic."

458,10142021027256,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown (CPL) lead to a significant decrease in emergency admissions worldwide. We performed a timely analysis of ischemic stroke (IS) and related consultations using the telestroke TEMPiS “working diagnosis” database prior (PL), within (WL), and after easing (EL) of CPL. METHODS: Twelve hospitals were selected and data analyzed regarding IS (including intravenous thrombolysis [intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen; IV rtPA] and endovascular thrombectomy [EVT]) and related events from February 1 to June 15 during 2017–2020. In addition, we aimed to correlate events to various mobile phone mobility data. RESULTS: Following the significant reduction of IS, IV rtPA, and EVT cases during WL compared to PL in 2020 longitudinally (p values <0.048), we observed increasing numbers of consultations, IS, recommendations for EVT, and IV rtPA with the network in EL over WL not reaching PL levels yet. Absolute numbers of all consultations paralleled best to mobility data of public transportation over walking and driving mobility. CONCLUSIONS: While the decrease in emergency admissions including stroke during CPL can only be in part attributed by patients not seeking medical attention, stroke awareness in the pandemic, and direct COVID-19 triggered stroke remains of high importance. The number of consultations in TEMPiS during the lockdown parallels best with mobility of public transportation. As a consequence, exposure to common viruses, well-known triggers for acute cerebrovascular events and other diseases, are reduced and may add to the decline in stroke consultations. Further studies comparing national responses toward the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and stroke incidences are needed."
459,10132021019579,"Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is the result of massive pro-inflammatory cytokine release and imbalance in the absence of adequate immunomodulation from signals such as interleukin (IL)-10, resulting in ongoing inflammation, tissue damage and death if left uncontrolled. Although CRS can result from different pro-inflammatory insults, the treatments proposed are similar, regardless of the phase of response. SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19, and CRS has been a defining feature of severe disease. Common approaches to treating CRS in other conditions are now applied to COVID-19 and, although some patients respond, it begs the following questions: (1) are all cytokine storms the same regardless of initiating insult, (2) can treatments be considered equally for all CRS events at any phase of the response, (3) can CRS be predicted based on dynamic acute biomarkers and, (4) should patients with CRS undergo long-term monitoring for secondary effects? The aim of this commentary is not to provide a review of COVID-19 pathophysiology or of cytokine storm, but rather to establish a foundation which could act as a platform to inform treatment approaches to CRS, regardless of cause, and the short- and long-term follow-up which may be necessary for affected patients."
460,10142021020539,"Since the 1970s, eight closely related serotypes of classical human astroviruses (HAstV) have been associated with gastrointestinal illness worldwide. In the late 2000s, three genetically unique human astrovirus clades, VA1-VA3, VA2-VA4, and MLB, were described. While the exact disease associated with these clades remains to be defined, VA1 has been associated with central nervous system infections. The discovery that VA1 could be grown in cell culture, supports exciting new studies aimed at understanding viral pathogenesis. Given the association of VA1 with often lethal CNS infections, we tested its susceptibility to the antimicrobial drug, nitazoxanide (NTZ), which we showed could inhibit classical HAstV infections. Our studies demonstrate that NTZ inhibited VA1 replication in Caco2 cells even when added at 12 h post-infection, which is later than in HAstV-1 infection. These data led us to further probe VA1 replication kinetics and cellular responses to infection in Caco-2 cells in comparison to the well-studied HAstV-1 strain. Overall, our studies highlight that VA1 replicates more slowly than HAstV-1 and elicits significantly different cellular responses, including the inability to disrupt cellular junctions and barrier permeability."
461,100720200710381,"The dynamics of immunity are crucial to understanding the long-term patterns of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. While the duration and strength of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is currently unknown, specific antibody titres to related coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been shown to wane in recovered individuals, and immunity to seasonal circulating coronaviruses is estimated to be shorter than one year. Using an age-structured, deterministic model, we explore different potential immunity dynamics using contact data from the UK population. In the scenario where immunity to SARS-CoV-2 lasts an average of three months for non-hospitalised individuals, a year for hospitalised individuals, and the effective reproduction number (Rt) after lockdown is 1.2 (our worst case scenario), we find that the secondary peak occurs in winter 2020 with a daily maximum of 409,000 infectious individuals; almost three-fold greater than in a scenario with permanent immunity. Our models suggests that longitudinal serological surveys to determine if immunity in the population is waning will be most informative when sampling takes place from the end of the lockdown until autumn 2020. After this period, the proportion of the population with antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is expected to increase due to the secondary peak. Overall, our analysis presents considerations for policy makers on the longer term dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK and suggests that strategies designed to achieve herd immunity may lead to repeated waves of infection if immunity to re-infection is not permanent."
462,10122020127015,"BACKGROUND: Anxiety and stress like mental illnesses are the common outcomes of viral epidemics and pandemics. Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus virus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) was first reported in Wuhan, China, and then spread all over the world in a short time. OBJECTIVES: To highlight and discuss the impact of COVID‐19 pandemic on mental or psychological health. METHOD: Literature search and collection of the information were performed using PubMed, the reports from the World health organization, and the Center for disease control and prevention. RESULTS: COVID‐19 infection has already been declared as a global pandemic, which in association with infodemic has increased the risk of psychiatric/psychological disorders. A large population of the world is prone to develop anxiety, depressive disorders, and other mental abnormalities. Therefore, timely psychological interventions and preventive strategies are required. Moreover, the infection has been reported to be linked with cerebrovascular conditions; therefore, patients with underlying cerebrovascular diseases should be given attention. CONCLUSION: COVID‐19‐mediated mental health complications and cerebrovascular conditions may cause a huge burden on healthcare communities in the future. Therefore, timely intervention and the development or application of preventive strategies are required to decrease the risk of neurological consequences."

Will they be of use to worried individuals and organizations? Or, are they artifacts of the very recent past? We conclude that these quickly‐produced scenarios are not embedded in the realities of affected communities and that the scenario development process should be enhanced to either involve power‐holding stakeholders or, more straightforwardly, to activate local consideration of how the affected community might/might not wish to react to localized dilemmas. Both enhancements will provide action‐orientated insights, beyond that of simply appreciating possible global/regional futures."
464,101320210110830,"BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic has resulted in thousands of infections and deaths worldwide. Several therapies are currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the development of new drugs and the repositioning of existing drugs can only be achieved after the identification of potential therapeutic targets within structures, as this strategy provides the most precise solution for developing treatments for sudden epidemic infectious diseases. SUMMARY: In the current investigation, crystal and cryo-electron microscopy structures encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome were systematically examined for the identification of potential drug targets. These structures include nonstructural proteins (Nsp-9; Nsp-12; and Nsp-15), nucleocapsid (N) proteins, and the main protease (M(pro)). KEY MESSAGE: The structural information reveals the presence of many potential alternative therapeutic targets, primarily involved in interaction between N protein and Nsp3, forming replication-transcription complexes (RTCs) which might be a potential drug target for effective control of current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. RTCs consist of 16 nonstructural proteins (Nsp1-16) that play the most essential role in the synthesis of viral RNA. Targeting the physical linkage between the envelope and single-stranded positive RNA, a process facilitated by matrix proteins may provide a good alternative strategy. Our current study provides useful information for the development of new lead compounds against SARS-CoV-2 infections."

466,10112020111005,"Contemporary organizations function in a complex business and operational environment composed of closely interdependent systems. They are also complex by their internal structure, management and deployed modern technologies. This complexity is not always well understood, and cannot be efficiently controlled. As the complexity and interdependencies increase, man-made systems become more unstable creating conditions for cascading, system-level failures causing serious threats to both themselves and society in general. Such breakdowns may consist of a) serious physical damages and destruction of their physical assets (caused by natural disasters, extreme weather phenomena and climate change, malicious human actions, etc.), and/or b) large functional disruptions with no physical damages of assets (caused by major organization’s internal disturbances, market crashes, pandemics, disruptions of supply chains, etc.). Those sources of risks are basically external to organizations. They are unable to control them, but are deeply affected by those risks. The latest case of the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates the above. It is affecting both all sectors of life and businesses worldwide. It convincingly shows that we need to think, plan and act globally in order to deal with such situations that will also take place in the future. Thus, organizations have to find ways of coping with this reality to remain economically viable. We are of opinion that the concepts of structured Asset Management (AM) and resilience put together may provide an efficient framework in this regard. Two case studies in a major North American electrical utility demonstrate the applicability of this approach: i) during an exceptional ice storm with significant damages of its physical assets, and ii) coping with challenges of COVID-19 with no destruction of its physical assets."

Its capacity for human-to-human transmission through respiratory droplets, coupled with a high-level of population mobility, has resulted in a rapid dissemination worldwide. Healthcare workers have been particularly exposed to the risk of infection and represent a significant proportion of COVID-19 cases in the worst affected regions of Europe. Like other open airway procedures or aerosol-generating procedures, bronchoscopy poses a significant risk of spreading contaminated droplets, and medical workers must adapt the procedures to ensure safety of both patients and staff. Several recommendation documents were published at the beginning of the pandemic, but as the situation evolves, our thoughts should not only focus on the present, but should also reflect on how we are going to deal with the presence of the virus in the community until there is a vaccine or specific treatment available. It is in this sense that this document aims to guide interventional pulmonology throughout this period, providing a set of recommendations on how to perform bronchoscopy or pleural procedures safely and efficiently."
470,10092020094503,"BACKGROUND Almost half of the estimated 5.3 million deaths of under-five children in 2018 occurred in sub-Saharan Africa with morbidity contributing substantially to these deaths. Seeking medical care for children has been described as an important measure of reducing mortality occasioned by morbidity. This study examined factors influencing mothers' health seeking behaviour for their children in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS This study made use of data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) of 31 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The study involved 75,982 children who received or did not receive measles vaccine and 93,142 children who sought or did not seek medical care when affected by fever or cough and diarrhoea. Binary logistic regression was applied in the analysis. RESULTS Most of the children (74%) received measles vaccine while less than one-fifth sought medical care for fever or cough (16%) and diarrhoea (10%). Majority of the children of women who received measles vaccine and sought medical care when they had fever or cough are from richest households. Children of women with primary and secondary or higher education, children of working women and children of women that attended antenatal care during pregnancy are more likely to seek medical care for fever or cough. While children of women who live in urban areas and children of second or higher order of birth are less likely to receive measles vaccine, children aged 24-35 months and those who were of average size at birth are less likely to seek medical care for diarrhoea. CONCLUSIONS This study has revealed that mothers' health care seeking behaviour for their children is influenced by social, maternal and child factors. Any intervention aimed at improving child health in sub-Sharan Africa should take these factors into consideration."

472,100920200913308,"The emergence of novel coronavirus (SARS‐CoV‐2) in 2019 in China marked the third outbreak of a highly pathogenic coronavirus infecting humans. The novel coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) spread worldwide, becoming an emergency of major international concern. However, even after a decade of coronavirus research, there are still no licensed vaccines or therapeutic agents to treat the coronavirus infection. In this context, apitherapy presents as a promising source of pharmacological and nutraceutical agents for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of COVID‐19. For instance, several honeybee products, such as honey, pollen, propolis, royal jelly, beeswax, and bee venom, have shown potent antiviral activity against pathogens that cause severe respiratory syndromes, including those caused by human coronaviruses. In addition, the benefits of these natural products to the immune system are remarkable, and many of them are involved in the induction of antibody production, maturation of immune cells, and stimulation of the innate and adaptive immune responses. Thus, in the absence of specific antivirals against SARS‐CoV‐2, apitherapy could offer one hope toward mitigating some of the risks associated with COVID‐19."

Given the role of the EU in wine supply, the aim of this paper is to present the design, the rationale and the potential effect of the proposed reform with specific reference to wine sector. To better understand the forthcoming process, it is firstly presented how CAP and its wine policy evolved in terms of objectives and tools over time. The EU wine policy is a paradigmatic example of a combination between the horizontal measures, valid for all agricultural sectors, and vertical measures, peculiarly encompassing the whole wine supply chain. The reform proposal confirms, with some interesting modifications, the set of tools already operating in the sector; however, it calls for a planning of the implementation of the available tools for all products in a unitary frame represented by a national CAP Strategic Plan, applying a lean administrative procedure. In the hypothesis that the COVID-19 outbreak will not cause a radical change in the global agri-food system, the proposed planning process should stimulate shared strategies. These are intended to effectively coordinate, according to the principle of complementarity, the implementation of available policy tools, in order to obtain a better use of resources and a more balanced achievement of all policy objectives."
474,10122020127773,"SARS-CoV-2 infection generally begins in the respiratory tract where it can cause bilateral pneumonia. The disease can evolve into acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure, due to viral spread in the blood and an excessive inflammatory reaction including cytokine storm. Antiviral and anti-cytokine drugs have proven to be poorly or in-effective in stopping disease progression, and mortality or serious chronic damage is common in severely ill cases. The low efficacy of antiviral drugs is probably due to late administration, when the virus has triggered the inflammatory reaction and is no longer the main protagonist. The relatively poor efficacy of anti-cytokine drugs is explained by the fact that they act on one or a few of the dozens of cytokines involved, and because other mediators of inflammation – reactive oxygen and nitrogen species – are not targeted. When produced in excess, reactive species cause extensive cell and tissue damage. The only drug known to inhibit the excessive production of reactive species and cytokines is methylene blue, a low-cost dye with antiseptic properties used effectively to treat malaria, urinary tract infections, septic shock, and methaemoglobinaemia. We propose testing methylene blue to contrast Covid-related acute respiratory distress syndrome, but particularly suggest testing it early in Covid infections to prevent the hyper-inflammatory reaction responsible for the serious complications of the disease."
475,10112020111763,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have made an indelible mark in the field of cancer immunotherapy. Starting with the approval of anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA-4) for advanced-stage melanoma in 2011, ICIs-which now also include antibodies against programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1)-quickly gained US Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of a wide array of cancer types, demonstrating unprecedented extension of patient survival. However, despite the success of ICIs, resistance to these agents restricts the number of patients able to achieve durable responses, and immune-related adverse events complicate treatment. Thus, a better understanding of the requirements for an effective and safe antitumor immune response following ICI therapy is needed. Studies of both tumoral and systemic changes in the immune system following ICI therapy have yielded insight into the basis for both efficacy and resistance. Ultimately, by building on these insights, researchers should be able to combine ICIs with other agents, or design new immunotherapies, to achieve broader and more durable efficacy as well as greater safety. Here, we review the history and clinical utility of ICIs, the mechanisms of resistance to therapy, and local and systemic immune cell changes associated with outcome.

The aim of this study was to report all the surgically intervened patients with suspected or confirmed SARS CoV-2 infection from April 1 to July 31, 2020, and to estimate their prognosis in the Surgical Therapy Department of a third level hospital in Mexico. METHOD: We conducted an observational study of patients undergoing surgical intervention in the operating room assigned as COVID, where we considered age, sex, treating department, type of intervention, and initial biomarkers (first five days of hospitalization), days of hospital stay, days in the Intensive Care Unit and reason for discharge. RESULTS: 42 patients have been surgically intervened, with a total of 49 surgeries. For Otolaringology and General Surgery, there were more deceased cases than alive cases; while for Thoracic Surgery, and Obstetrics and Gynecology, there were more alive cases than deceased ones (36% and 0% deceased, respectively), with statistically significant differences (p = 0.014). With regard to mortality for each group of surgical procedure, patients who underwent C-section or pleurostomy had a mortality rate of 0%; the mortality rate for patients who underwent tracheostomy was 52%; patients who underwent laparotomy had a mortality rate of 54%; for those who underwent debridement, the mortality rate was 100%; which show significant differences, with a p value of 0.03. DISCUSSION: we identified an overall mortality rate of 42.8%, with a significant difference between treating departments and type of surgical procedure. This can be explained because many of the General Surgery patients, in addition to their infectious process by COVID-19, had another complication, like sepsis, In the same way, we can say that pregnant patients are healthy and have a physiological condition. Finally, patients undergoing an open tracheostomy had solely pulmonary complications. CONCLUSION: There is no doubt that we face an unknown condition for which we have been learning tests along the way. This sample of cases undergoing surgery at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic can provide clues on relevant results that we must consider for future cases."

480,10092020094265,"High ambient temperature is one of the most important environmental factors that caused the reduction of livestock productivity and the increase of mortality. It has been shown that heat stress could affect the meat quality characteristics by physiological and metabolic perturbations in live livestock. Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a natural polyphenolic phytochemical compound that has many important biological activities, such as antioxidant, antimutagenic, and antitumor. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible function and mechanism of RA on myoblast proliferation and differentiation under heat stress condition. The results showed that heat stress reduced the viability of myoblast and increased the percentage of apoptotic cells, and it also disrupted myotube formation by altering the expression of myogenic regulatory factors MyoD, myogenin, and MyHC. However, pretreatment of RA can protect C2C12 cells from heat stress-induced apoptosis, and it also increased the expression level of MyoD, myogenin, and MyHC under heat stress, which indicated that RA have protective effect on heat stress-caused failure of myotube formation during myoblast differentiation. Above all, our finding demonstrated that RA can promote the differentiation of C2C12 myoblast and maintain the formation of myotubes even under heat stress condition."
481,10012020010055,"BACKGROUNDS: The aim of this study is investigating the benefits and harms of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: We comprehensively searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library for randomized controlled trials comparing NMBAs to any other comparator. We pooled data using relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals. We assessed the quality of included studies using the Cochrane tool and levels of evidence using the GRADE method. RESULTS: Finally, six RCTs (n = 1557 patients) were eligible for analysis. The results showed NMBAs use was not associated with reduced 28 days mortality (RR 0.78; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.06; P = 0.11), 90 days mortality (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.04; P = 0.16), and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.03; P = 0.13) in patients with ARDS. However, 21–28 days mortality was slightly lower in patients received NMBAs (RR 0.73; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.99; P = 0.04; I(2) = 53%). Besides, NMBAs use could improve the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio at 48 and 72 h, decrease plateau pressure and PEEP at 72 h. Additionally, NMBAs had no significant effects on days free of ventilation at day 28 (WMD, 0.55; 95% CI, − 0.46 to 1.57; P = 0.29), days not in ICU at day 28 (WMD, 0.12; 95% CI, − 0.85 to 1.08; P = 0.82), ICU-acquired weakness (RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.93; P = 0.06). Finally, NMBAs use was associated with a lower risk of barotrauma (RR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.85; P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: In patients with respiratory distress syndrome, NMBAs may be beneficial in reverse refractory hypoxemia and may be associated with reduced short-term mortality and incidence of barotrauma. However, there is no significant effects of NMBAs on mid-term and long-term mortality, and further studies are required."

We organize our recommendations around five policy priorities: expanding insurance coverage, accelerating the transition to value-based care, advancing home-based care, improving the affordability of drugs and other therapeutics, and developing a high-value workforce. Within each priority we provide recommendations for key elected officials and political appointees that could be used as starting points for evidence-based policy making that supports a more effective, efficient, and equitable health system in the US."
483,10142021028603,"Convalescent plasma has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has received emergency use authorization, and is being widely used during the COVID-19 pandemic. Passive antibody therapy via plasma or serum has been successfully used to treat infectious diseases for more than a century. Passive antibody administration is based on the presumption that convalescent plasma or serum contains therapeutic antibodies that can be passively transferred to the plasma recipient. There are numerous examples in which convalescent plasma has been used successfully as post-exposure prophylaxis and treatment of infectious diseases, including previous coronavirus outbreaks. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, convalescent plasma was demonstrated to be safe and potentially effective among patients infected with COVID-19. This review provides an overview of the historical uses of convalescent plasma therapy, summarizes current evidence for convalescent plasma use for COVID-19, and highlights future antibody therapies."
484,101320210111290,"How does one interpret the observed increase or decrease in COVID19 case rates? Did the compliance to the non pharmaceutical interventions, seasonal changes in the temperature influence the transmission rates or are they purely an artefact of the number of tests? To answer these questions, we estimate the effect sizes from these different factors on the reproduction ratios (Rt) from the different states of the USA during March 9 to August 9. Ideally Rt should be less than 1 to keep the pandemic under control and our model predicts many of these factors contributed significantly to the Rt: Post-lockdown opening of the restaurants and nightclubs contributed 0.04 (CI 0.04-0.04) and 0.11 (CI. 0.11-0.11) to Rt. The mask mandates helped reduce Rt by 0.28 (CI 0.28-0.29)), whereas the testing rates which may have influenced the number of infections observed, did not influence Rt beyond 10,000 daily tests 0.07 (CI -0.57-0.42). In our attempt to understand the role of temperature, the contribution to the Rt was found to increase on both sides of 55 F, which we infer as a reflection of the climatisation needs. A further analysis using the cooling and heating needs showed contributions of 0.24 (CI 0.18-0.31) and 0.31 (CI 0.28-0.33) respectively. The work thus illustrates a data-driven approach for estimating the effect-sizes on the graded policies, and the possibility of prioritising the interventions, if necessary by weighing the economic costs and ease of acceptance with them."

486,10172021058646,"INTRODUCTION: The study aimed to devise a self-referral mobile/web application for patients with new breast symptoms, giving them an outcome, thus bypassing the need for primary care consultation. METHODS: The online application was designed on the automated algorithm based on evidence-based guidelines for referral to breast onco-plastic units. A retrospective questionnaire-based anonymous survey was carried out at the breast unit in Southend University Hospital (January 2019 to March 2020). The outcome of the patients was recorded, the same data was entered in the software and its outcome was compared with their clinic outcome to assess and validate the software. Chi-square and t-test were used in formulating results. RESULTS: Data was collected for 366 patients who were referred urgently to the clinic. Only 50.5% (n = 186) were appropriately referred, with the main complaint being breast lump (94.1%). 39.6% of referred patients did not require a secondary care referral. Sensitivity and specificity for identifying patients requiring urgent referral was 100% and 98%, respectively. CONCLUSION: A significant number of urgent referrals to breast units do not require urgent specialist referral, and this results in a big strain on the hospital service. The discussed self-referral pathway is a promising alternative with the potential to reduce workload in primary and secondary care and improve patient satisfaction."
487,100720200711921,"The way chemists represent chemical structures as two-dimensional sketches made up of atoms and bonds, simplifying the complex three-dimensional molecules comprising nuclei and electrons of the quantum mechanical description, is the everyday language of chemistry. This language uses models, particularly of bonding, that are not contained in the quantum mechanical description of chemical systems, but has been used to derive machine-readable formats for storing and manipulating chemical structures in digital computers. This language is fuzzy and varies from chemist to chemist but has been astonishingly successful and perhaps contributes with its fuzziness to the success of chemistry. It is this creative imagination of chemical structures that has been fundamental to the cognition of chemistry and has allowed thought experiments to take place. Within the everyday language, the model nature of these concepts is not always clear to practicing chemists, so that controversial discussions about the merits of alternative models often arise. However, the extensive use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in chemistry, with the aim of being able to make reliable predictions, will require that these models be extended to cover all relevant properties and characteristics of chemical systems. This, in turn, imposes conditions such as completeness, compactness, computational efficiency and non-redundancy on the extensions to the almost universal Lewis and VSEPR bonding models. Thus, AI and ML are likely to be important in rationalizing, extending and standardizing chemical bonding models. This will not affect the everyday language of chemistry but may help to understand the unique basis of chemical language."
488,10172021057575,"Emergency endoscopy in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients should be avoided whenever possible to ensure the safety of medical staff; however, it may be unavoidable in some cases. We report a case of emergency lower gastrointestinal endoscopy performed with full personal protective equipment in a patient on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation with severe COVID-19 pneumonia admitted in a restricted area under negative pressure in the intensive care unit. To avoid the risk of fecal–oral transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during the procedure, the patient’s lower body was covered with a 2 m(2) vinyl sheet with an aperture (diameter, approximately 2 cm). None of the medical staff involved exhibited any signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection after the procedure. Although patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation have a high risk of bleeding, we believe that emergency lower endoscopy can be safely performed in such patients by reducing exposure to dispersed feces and using full personal protective equipment."
489,10102020105917,"The prevailing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has challenged our lives in an unprecedented manner. The pandemic has had a significant impact on transplantation worldwide. The logistics of travel restrictions, stretching of available resources, unclear risk of infection in immunosuppressed transplant recipients, and evolving guidelines on testing and transplantation are some of the factors that have unfavourably influenced transplant activity. We must begin to build organisational flexibility in order to restart transplantation so that we can be mindful stewards of organ donation and sincere advocates for our patients. Building a culture of honesty and transparency (with patients, families, colleagues, societies, and authorities), keeping the channels of communication open, working in collaboration with others (at local, regional, national, and international levels), and not restarting without rethinking and appraising all elements of our practice, are the main underlying principles to increase the flexibility."

491,10122020129986,"The SARS-CoV-2/ COVID-19 pandemic has spread across the globe and affected millions of individuals as of the efficient virus transmission potential mediated via multiple virus shedding routes. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the stool samples and its prolonged shedding in environmental compartments like sewage and wastewater signifies a potential threat adding to the transmission cycle of this novel virus. The potential role played by the asymptomatic COVID-19 patients in transmitting the disease via the fecal-oral route is now under investigation. Hence, in the present scenario, wastewater-based epidemiology, and sewage surveillance may provide valuable insights into the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among the human population and could serve as a sensitive surveillance system and a crucial early warning tool. Further studies are required to determine the survival of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment, transmissibility through wastewater, and the potential to infect humans via the fecal-oral route. Appropriate frameworks with regards to evaluation and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 will help implement appropriate intervention strategies and necessary sanitation practices to ensure virus free clean water supply to have a check on the further spread of this pandemic virus."
492,10112020118021,"OBJECTIVE: With the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been supply challenges necessitating that laboratories must prepare their own viral transport medium (VTM), which provides stability for clinical specimens for diagnostic viral testing. METHODS: Within a veteran affairs medical center clinical laboratory, VTM was prepared with a Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) 500 mL bottle with phenol red, sterile heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), gentamicin sulfate (50 mg/mL), and amphotericin B (250 μg/mL). An antimicrobial mixture was made of 50 mL each of amphotericin B and gentamicin sulfate. Ten mL of FBS and 2 mL of the antimicrobial mixture were mixed into the HBSS bottle, from which 3 mL aliquots were made. Sterility and efficacy check were assessed. These preparations were conducted at our VAMC’s clinical laboratory to assure adequate VTM supply during the COVID-19 shortage. RESULTS: The VTM was successfully prepared in-house, supporting uninterrupted testing for the facility and other affiliated medical facilities/centers and community living centers. CONCLUSION: This quality assurance/improvement report represents the first published manuscript on feasible VTM preparation exclusively within a clinical microbiology laboratory during the COVID-19 pandemic."
493,10172021059558,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has killed over 2.5 million people worldwide, but effective care and therapy have yet to be discovered. We conducted this analysis to better understand tocilizumab treatment for COVID-19 patients. MAIN TEXT: We searched major databases for manuscripts reporting the effects of tocilizumab on COVID-19 patients. A total of 25 publications were analyzed with Revman 5.3 and R for the meta-analysis. Significant better clinical outcomes were found in the tocilizumab treatment group when compared to the standard care group [odds ratio (OR) = 0.70, 95% confidential interval (C): 0.54–0.90, P = 0.007]. Tocilizumab treatment showed a stronger correlation with good prognosis among COVID-19 patients that needed mechanical ventilation (OR = 0.59, 95% CI, 0.37–0.93, P = 0.02). Among stratified analyses, reduction of overall mortality correlates with tocilizumab treatment in patients less than 65 years old (OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.60–0.77, P < 0.00001), and with intensive care unit patients (OR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.55–0.70, P < 0.00001). Pooled estimates of hazard ratio showed that tocilizumab treatment predicts better overall survival in COVID-19 patients (HR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.24–0.84, P = 0.01), especially in severe cases (HR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.49–0.68, P < 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that tocilizumab treatment is associated with a lower risk of mortality and mechanical ventilation requirement among COVID-19 patients. Tocilizumab may have substantial effectiveness in reducing mortality among COVID-19 patients, especially among critical cases. This systematic review provides an up-to-date evidence of potential therapeutic role of tocilizumab in COVID-19 management.

494,10062020069431,"Due to the high perceived risk, it is critical to foster users’ initial trust in the promotion of mobile online health community (MOHC) adoption. The present study focused on the role of two different trust elements and examined the initial trust building process based on elaboration likelihood model and trust transfer theory. The results indicated that initial trust in MOHC context was composed of two interrelated components: health service provider (doctor) and underlying technology (MOHC platform). Especially, the initial trust in MOHC platform exerted greater effects on adopting intention. Both performance-based cue (doctors’ information quality and interaction quality) and transfer-based cue (trust in the offline doctors’ health service) positively shaped the initial trust in doctor. Meanwhile, only the performance-based cue (MOHC platform’s information quality and service quality) has significant positive association with initial trust in MOHC platform. However, interpersonal recommend is insignificantly related to the initial trust in doctor. Trust in the mobile internet service is insignificantly related to the initial trust in MOHC platform."
495,10082020088695,"One of the most challenging keys to understand COVID-19 evolution is to have a measure on those mild cases which are never tested because their few symptoms are soft and/or fade away soon. The problem is not only that they are difficult to identify and test, but also that it is believed that they may constitute the bulk of the cases and could be crucial in the pandemic equation. We present a novel and simple algorithm to extract the number of these mild cases by correlating a COVID-line phone calls to reported cases in given districts. The key assumption is to realize that, being a highly contagious disease, the number of calls by mild cases should be proportional to the number of reported cases. Whereas a background of calls not related to infected people should be proportional to the district population. We present the plain mathematics of the method and as a working example we apply it to Buenos Aires Province (Argentina), where it is being currently used. The implementation of this algorithm by other regions would be straightforward and would provide compelling information to the corresponding Health Care Administration."

497,10022020020434,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Few studies have examined the possibility of a link between birth season and the risk for asthma. Those studies that mainly focused on young children, reached different conclusions regarding both the existence of such a link and the season with the highest risk. The purpose of this study was to reinvestigate the relationship between birth season and asthma in a very large cohort, larger than in all previous studies, focusing on adolescents. METHODS The medical records of consecutive 17-year-old conscripts, born between 1978 and 1999, undergoing medical evaluation before their military service, were reviewed. The prevalence of asthma among conscripts was calculated according to the season of birth. RESULTS Data from 6 26 460 males and 4 54 104 females were collected. Asthma prevalence was 6.6% of the males and 5.8% of the females. Asthma prevalence was highest among those born in the summer and was approximately 9% higher in women and 6% higher in men than those born in the winter. Those born in the winter had the lowest prevalence of asthma. June was the birth month with the highest prevalence of asthma in both genders together with September among males. CONCLUSIONS Being born in the summer, especially in June, is associated with an increased risk of asthma compared with a winter birth among Israeli army conscripts. Further research is required to determine the impact of the season of birth on the risk of asthma in higher risk populations."
498,101220201211155,"During the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, interpersonal interactions are restricted to social networks. Undergraduate students are isolated in their homes and dorms. Loneliness is closely related to psychological distress. Fear of contracting the disease will worsen psychological distress. The purpose of this study was to assess the severity of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms among undergraduate students and their relationships with social networking sites usage during the COVID-19 lockdown. An online survey was used to recruit 456 participants for this cross-sectional descriptive study. Self-reported questionnaires were used to collect data on students' demographics, depression, anxiety, stress, and social networking usage. The results revealed that the majority of students had symptoms of depression (74.1%), anxiety (59.6%), and stress (61.2%). Female students had higher depression and anxiety symptoms than males. Senior-level students' psychological distress symptoms were significantly different from those of junior level. The largest percentage of students (91.9%) used social networking sites for entertainment. The academic usage of social networking sites was negatively (p < .05) correlated with depression and stress scores, while entertainment usage was positively correlated with anxiety. Age was not found to be significantly correlated with psychological distress. Academic and entertainment use of social networking sites were successfully associated with psychological distress symptoms after controlling for demographics. During this unprecedented time of undergraduate students’ course of study, they were experiencing higher than average distress symptoms. These symptoms could be mitigated by continuing the regular academic activities and delivering the most accurate up-to-date information on the COVID-19 through social networking sites."
499,10122020121302,"This book aims to substantiate the fact that religion still plays a key role in our contemporary society and that it is important to retain SRE/SRI in government schools. SRE provides a number of key benefits. These include firstly values education within the framework of belief in God or a higher spiritual being, which has been shown to be a powerful factor in empowering student decisions, fostering their ability to act and assigning student responsibility. Secondly, religious belief has been shown to strengthen students’ sense of identity and belonging and to have important psychological benefits for students’ mental health and wellbeing. Thirdly, retaining the rich mix of the different faith communities strengthens Australia’s multicultural fabric. Finally, SRE/RI classes provide safe places for students to explore the deeper questions of their religion and identity. At the same time, this study argues that SRE/RI pedagogy needs to be brought into the twenty-first century, ensuring best practice drawing on constructivist, reflected, critical pedagogy to achieve the core competencies of Social and Emotional Learning (SEL). This is needed to meaningfully engage the next generation. To achieve this goal, SRE/RI providers, with government support and assistance, need ongoing professional development and more effective transparency, accountability and supervision. As well, for effective multicultural education, a combination of Special Religious Education (SRE) with General Religious Education (GRE) is needed, so that children can, on the one hand, explore their own religious identity, and on the other hand learn about and interact with children of different religious faiths. This book argues that adopting these best practice approaches will meet the criticisms expressed about SRE/RI pedagogy to ensure a robust SRE/RI curriculum which is suitably equipped to develop students in contemporary Australian society. A strengthened SRE/RI program will enrich Australian society and improve students’ mental health and wellbeing, assisting to equip them to be confident, functioning adults in the rapidly changing contemporary world."

501,10052020050712,"This study examines the impact of several institutional factor conditions on entrepreneurship in difficult macroeconomic environments such as a systemic banking crisis. It uses data from the National Expert Survey (NES–GEM). A total of 1771 national entrepreneurship experts representing 44 countries were included in the analysis. Using Laeven and Valencia (2013)’s criteria, 20 countries were considered as most affected by the global economic crisis (group 1) and 24 as less affected (included in group 2) in order to test if opportunity perceptions are significantly affected in times of recovery. In terms of findings, the study confirms that institutional factor conditions strongly impact on the opportunity to create a new business regardless of how damaged the economy of countries hit by the crisis was. Among the six institutional factors studied, four are found to be statistically significant and two are partially significant. The interacting effects of systemic banking crisis and the exposure to international conditions kept the previous relationship relatively unchanged. In terms of contributions, the study first highlights the importance of the institutional view in explaining the opportunities to start-up in the aftermath of a crisis. Second, the study compares the proposed relationships between four sub-sample data sets based on trade openness and banking crisis severity. From a practical and government perspective, this study provides a useful picture of the yet limited understanding of the role that institutions and trade openness can play in entrepreneurs’ perceptions and thus in economic recovery dynamics."
502,10112020117312,"Outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a great challenge for scientific community globally. Virus enters cell through spike glycoprotein fusion with ACE2 (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2) human receptor. Hence, spike glycoprotein of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a potential target for diagnostics, vaccines, and antibodies. Also, virus entry can be prevented by blocking ACE2 thus, ACE2 can be considered potential target for therapeutics. As being highly specific, safe and efficacious, peptides hold their place in therapeutics. In present study, we retrieved sequence of 70 peptides from Antiviral Peptide Database (AVPdb), modelled them using 3D structure predicting web tool and docked them with receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein and human host receptor ACE2 using peptide-protein docking. It was observed that peptides have more affinity towards ACE2 in comparison with spike RBD. Interestingly it was noticed that most of the peptides bind to RBM (residue binding motif) which is responsible for ACE2 binding at the interface of RBD while, for ACE2, peptides prefer to bind the core cavity rather than RBD binding interface. To further investigate how peptides at the interface of RBD or ACE2 alter the binding between RBD and ACE2, protein–protein docking of RBD and ACE2 with and without peptides was performed. Peptides, AVP0671 at RBD and AVP1244 at ACE2 interfaces significantly reduce the binding affinity and change the orientation of RBD and ACE2 binding. This finding suggests that peptides can be used as a drug to inhibit virus entry in cells to stop COVID-19 pandemic in the future after experimental evidences.

503,101520210314586,"OBJECTIVE: To explore orthopaedic and musculoskeletal clinicians’ views and experiences of legal, safety, safeguarding and security issues regarding the use of virtual consultations (VC) during the COVID-19 pandemic. A secondary objective was to suggest ways to overcome these issues. METHODS: A mixed method cross-sectional survey was conducted, seeking the views and experiences of orthopaedic and musculoskeletal medically qualified and Allied Health Professionals in the United Kingdom. Descriptive statistical analysis was employed for quantitative data and a qualitative content analysis undertaken for qualitative data. Findings were presented in accordance with the four key issues. RESULTS: Two hundred and ninety professionals (206 physiotherapists, 78 medically qualified professionals, 6 ‘other’ therapists) participated in the survey. Of the 290 participants, 260 (90%) were not using VC prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 248 respondents (86%) were unsure whether their professional indemnity insurance covered VC, 136 (47%) had considered how they would handle an issue of safeguarding whilst the remainder had not, 126 (43%) had considered what they would do if, during a virtual consultation, a patient suffered an injury (e.g. bang on their head) or a fall (e.g. mechanical or a medical event like syncope) and 158 (54%) reported they felt the current technological solutions are secure in terms of patient data. Qualitative data provided additional context to support the quantitative findings such as validity of indemnification, accuracy of diagnosis and consent using VC, safeguarding issues; and security and sharing of data. Potential changes to practice have been proposed to address these issues. CONCLUSIONS: VC have been rapidly deployed since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic often without clear guidance or consensus on many important issues. This study identified legal, safeguarding, safety and security issues. There is an urgent need to address these and develop local and national guidance and frameworks to facilitate ongoing safe virtual orthopaedic practice beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.

504,10172021051104,"INTRODUCTION: Axillary conservation is the way forward after game changing trials like ACOSOG Z0011, surrogate trials like IBCSG,AMAROS, ALMANAC, on-going POSNOC, and newbie ATNEC have decreased the need to fiddle with the axilla. Current standard is the utilisation of double technique with radioisotope and blue dye to decrease false negative rates for true sentinel node retrieval. METHOD: Literature search on the topic in the last two decades. RESULTS: The search yielded 197 publications which were subjected to a meticulous review. CONCLUSIONS: Single agent radioisotope is recommended in palpable and good biology breast tumours. Use of single agent blue dye can be standardised in axillary tail tumours. It is also recommended when isotope mapping is logistically not feasible or during pandemics like COVID 19 where looming infrastructure challenges are prevalent. Dual agent technique should be considered in previously treated breast and axilla, neoadjuvant chemotherapy cohort, bad tumour biology, high BMI and macromastia groups for true nodal retrieval. Optimal number of nodes taken out should not be more than three (n = 3). Lower axillary sampling of not more than 3 nodes is recommended for troubleshooting. Magnetic tracing can be used as an adjunct to either single agent (RI/BD) technique when there is failure to localise the sentinel node."
505,10042020044966,"Abstract The symptoms associated with COVID-19 are mainly characterized by a triad composed of fever, dry cough and dyspnea. However, digestive symptoms have also been reported; at first considered as infrequent, they in fact seem to affect (to some extent) more than half of patients. The symptoms are mainly manifested by anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and/or vomiting and abdominal pain. Even though prognosis is associated with lung injury, digestive symptoms seem significantly more frequent in patients presenting with severe COVID-19 infection. Digestive forms, which may be isolated or which can precede pulmonary symptoms, have indeed been reported, with diarrhea as a leading clinical sign. The main biological abnormalities that can suggest COVID-19 infection at an early stage are lymphopenia, elevated CRP and heightened ASAT transaminases. Thoraco-abdominal scan seems useful as a means of on the one hand ruling out digestive pathology not connected with coronavirus and on the other hand searching for pulmonary images compatible with COVID-19 infection. No data exist on the interest of digestive endoscopy in cases of persistent digestive symptoms. Moreover, the endoscopic surgeons may themselves be at significant risk of contamination. Fecal-oral transmission of the infection is possible, especially insofar as viral shedding in stools seems frequent and of longer duration than at the ENT level, including in patients with negative throat swab and without digestive symptoms. In some doubtful cases, virologic assessment of stool samples can yield definitive diagnosis. In the event of prolonged viral shedding in stools, a patient’s persistent contagiousness is conceivable but not conclusively established. Upcoming serology should enable identification of the patients having been infected by the COVID-19 epidemic, particularly among previously undetected pauci-symptomatic members of a health care staff. Resumption of medico-surgical activity should be the object of a dedicated strategy preceding deconfinement."
506,10142021021141,"During these first months of 2020, the world is experiencing the most ruthless health crisis in modern history. This has led different areas of society to change their lifestyle or the way they are carried out. One of them is teaching, especially engineering education. This has required a sudden transformation of the methodology and the use of digital tools, as well as the training of teachers in an expeditious manner. The Tecnologico de Monterrey, one of the best private universities in Latin America, stopped its activities on March 20 to promote social distancing as a security measure against the COV19 (SARS-2-COV coronavirus) pandemic. This implied that at week 6 of the spring semester 2020, the courses would suddenly become a part of a newly implemented flexible digital model from home for both, the teacher and the student, preventing attendance to school facilities. In this manuscript, we analyze the response of 3 groups of specific subjects from the Bioengineering Department that were migrated. One of these subjects was precisely the Microbiology Laboratory for Engineers, which involved a major challenge. The teachers received adequate training for a week and students were then transferred to the new synchronous online model. Knowledge acquisition analysis and satisfaction surveys showed that the implementation of this digital model was adequate to achieve the academic objectives set from the beginning of the 2019–2020 academic year."

These include movement-based approaches to awareness of the internal body (interoception), the external environment (exteroception) and movement in space (proprioception). These significantly work with the lived subjective experiences of people living with pain, to become aware of body signals and self-management of symptoms, explore fear and pleasure of movement, and understand how social environments impact on pain. This analysis has potential to create new ways of supporting, understanding and articulating pain experiences, as well as shaping the future of somatic practices for chronic pain."
509,100920200912016,"In December 2019, physicians reported numerous patients showing pneumonia of unknown origin in the Chinese region of Wuhan. Following the spreading of the infection over the world, The World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020 declared the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak a global pandemic. The scientific community is exerting an extraordinary effort to elucidate all aspects related to SARS-CoV-2, such as the structure, ultrastructure, invasion mechanisms, replication mechanisms, or drugs for treatment, mainly through in vitro studies. Thus, the clinical in vivo data can provide a test bench for new discoveries in the field of SARS-CoV-2, finding new solutions to fight the current pandemic. During this dramatic situation, the normal scientific protocols for the development of new diagnostic procedures or drugs are frequently not completely applied in order to speed up these processes. In this context, interdisciplinarity is fundamental. Specifically, a great contribution can be provided by the association and interpretation of data derived from medical disciplines based on the study of images, such as radiology, nuclear medicine, and pathology. Therefore, here, we highlighted the most recent histopathological and imaging data concerning the SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung and other human organs such as the kidney, heart, and vascular system. In addition, we evaluated the possible matches among data of radiology, nuclear medicine, and pathology departments in order to support the intense scientific work to address the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In this regard, the development of artificial intelligence algorithms that are capable of correlating these clinical data with the new scientific discoveries concerning SARS-CoV-2 might be the keystone to get out of the pandemic."

METHODS: This study included 104 participants, ≥18 years old who were previous patients of family health clinics for a variety of reasons in the months preceding the onset of the Covid‐19 pandemic. The Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence was administered to these patients as part of their initial intakes. The participants were asked to complete a questionnaire related to socio‐demographic information and the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence after obtaining agreement to participate during the pandemic period. In addition, written informed consent was obtained. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 20, was used to analyse the acquired data. RESULTS: The participants were 48.1% and 51.9% women and men, respectively. The pre‐pandemic and Covid‐19 pandemic mean smoking addiction scores were 5.03 and 5.6, respectively. The smoking addiction levels before and during the Covid‐19 pandemic significantly differed (P < .001). Of the individuals with low smoking addiction levels before the pandemic, 17.6% and 29.4% became moderately and highly addicted, respectively. Of the individuals with moderate smoking addiction level, 6.3% and 43.9% became lowly and highly addicted, respectively. CONCLUSION: The smoking addiction level may change based on various factors including behavioural changes. While increases in smoking addiction during the pandemic can be observed caused by behavioural changes and anxieties that may arise because of the pandemic, a decrease in addiction levels and even smoking cessation can also be observed during these times because of the more progressive course of Covid‐19 in smokers. Health institutions should therefore take advantage of this period and focus more efforts on the cessation of smoking and other substance abuse issues."
511,10082020086860,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the low-dose chest computed tomography (CT) presentation and dynamic changes in patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to improve understanding of this highly infectious disease. METHODS: The clinical and CT data of 16 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Dynamic CTs were performed continuously after admission. RESULTS: Of the patients, 14 were moderate cases, and 2 were severe. Twelve patients underwent CT at the early onset stage. Single nodules or ground-glass opacities (GGOs) were found in 2 patients and multiple bilateral pulmonary lesions in 8 (consolidation-like opacities with or without small nodules in five and large GGOs with interlobular septal thickening in three). Ten had lesion growth and enlargement on the second CT. Fourteen patients underwent CT during the progressive stage, which revealed GGOs and focal consolidation in 6 of them, lung consolidation opacities in 5, and simple, large GGOs with interlobular septal thickening in 3. In both severe cases, the lesions continued to enlarge and grow, and the extent of consolidation continued to expand. CONCLUSION: Low-dose chest CT can clearly reflect the morphology, density, and extent of COVID-19 nodules, and is beneficial for observing dynamic nodule changes and disease screening and monitoring."
512,100820200810229,"Background: The current coronavirus (COVID‐19) pandemic is associated with severe pulmonary and cardiovascular complications. Case presentation: This report describes a young patient with COVID‐19 without any comorbidity presenting with severe cardiovascular complications, manifesting with pulmonary embolism, embolic stroke, and right heart failure.

513,10092020096472,"Online therapy sessions and other forms of digital mental health services (DMH) have seen a sharp spike in new users since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Having little access to their social networks and support systems, people have had to turn to digital tools and spaces to cope with their experiences of anxiety and loss. With no clear end to the pandemic in sight, many of us are likely to remain reliant upon DMH for the foreseeable future. As such, it is important to articulate some of the specific ways in which the pandemic is affecting our self and world-relation, such that we can identify how DMH services are best able to accommodate some of the newly emerging needs of their users. In this paper I will identify a specific type of loss brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and present it as an important concept for DMH. I refer to this loss as loss of perceptual world-familiarity. Loss of perceptual world-familiarity entails a breakdown in the ongoing effortless responsiveness to our perceptual environment that characterizes much of our everyday lives. To cash this out I will turn to insights from the phenomenological tradition. Initially, my project is descriptive. I aim to bring out how loss of perceptual world-familiarity is a distinctive form of loss that is deeply pervasive yet easily overlooked—hence the relevance of explicating it for DMH purposes. But I will also venture into the space of the normative, offering some reasons for seeing perceptual world-familiarity as a component of well-being. I conclude the paper with a discussion of how loss of perceptual world-familiarity affects the therapeutic setting now that most if not all therapeutic interactions have transitioned to online spaces and I explore the potential to augment these spaces with social interaction technologies. Throughout, my discussion aims to do justice to the reality that perceptual world-familiarity is not an evenly distributed phenomenon, that factors like disability, gender and race affect its robustness, and that this ought to be reckoned with when seeking to incorporate the phenomenon into or mitigate it through DMH services."
514,101120201111428,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a scientifically and medically novel disease that is not fully understood because it has yet to be consistently and deeply studied. Among the gaps in research on the COVID-19 outbreak, there is a lack of sufficient infoveillance data. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to increase understanding of public awareness of COVID-19 pandemic trends and uncover meaningful themes of concern posted by Twitter users in the English language during the pandemic. METHODS: Data mining was conducted on Twitter to collect a total of 107,990 tweets related to COVID-19 between December 13 and March 9, 2020. The analyses included frequency of keywords, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling to identify and explore discussion topics over time. A natural language processing approach and the latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm were used to identify the most common tweet topics as well as to categorize clusters and identify themes based on the keyword analysis. RESULTS: The results indicate three main aspects of public awareness and concern regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. First, the trend of the spread and symptoms of COVID-19 can be divided into three stages. Second, the results of the sentiment analysis showed that people have a negative outlook toward COVID-19. Third, based on topic modeling, the themes relating to COVID-19 and the outbreak were divided into three categories: the COVID-19 pandemic emergency, how to control COVID-19, and reports on COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Sentiment analysis and topic modeling can produce useful information about the trends in the discussion of the COVID-19 pandemic on social media as well as alternative perspectives to investigate the COVID-19 crisis, which has created considerable public awareness. This study shows that Twitter is a good communication channel for understanding both public concern and public awareness about COVID-19. These findings can help health departments communicate information to alleviate specific public concerns about the disease."
515,10142021022448,"Background In order to find out the factors associated with the large disparities in COVID-19 mortality rates by country, we conducted an ecological study by linking existing statistics. In Japan, a large variation was observed in between geographical areas when assessing mortality. We performed a regional correlation analysis to find factors related to regional mortality. Methods This study design was an ecologic study. A multiple regression analysis was performed with COVID-19 mortality rates of different countries as the dependent variable together with various health care and economic factors. We calculated the cumulative mortality rate as of June 30, 2020. For the regional correlation analysis of Japan, 47 prefectures were divided into nine regions. The factors examined were health care and tourism. Data for 33 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries were analyzed. In Japan's regional analysis, the whole country was classified into nine regions. Results Factors related to mortality were the incidence of Kawasaki disease (KD), number of computed tomographies (CTs), and alcohol consumption. Mortality was low in countries with high incidence of KD and high number of CTs, as well as in countries with high alcohol consumption. In European countries, high smoking prevalence and a high Gini coefficient were positively related to high mortality. According to a regional analysis in Japan, mortality was related to proportion of population in the densely inhabited districts, the number of foreign visitors per capita, and the number of Chinese visitors per capita. Conclusion Low mortality in East Asia was associated with specific disease morbidity (KD), alcohol consumption, and CT numbers. It was suggested that the mortality gap in Japan was related to the number of foreign tourists and the proportion of population in the densely inhabited districts."
516,10092020099741,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study aimed to collect information on the opinions of Korean infectious disease (ID) experts on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related issues in preparation for a future outbreak. METHODS: A survey was conducted over the course of 5 days (from April 21 to 25, 2020), targeting all adult ID specialists currently in the medical field in South Korea (n = 265). An online-based survey was forwarded via text message and e-mail. Only one response was accepted from each participant. RESULTS: Of these 265 ID specialists gotten to, 132 (49.8%) responded. The highest proportion of the respondents envisaged the current COVID-19 outbreak to end after December 2020 (47.7% for the domestic Korean outbreak and 70.5% for the global pandemic); moreover, 60.7% of them stated that a second nationwide wave is likely to occur between September and December 2020 in South Korea. N95 respirators were considered to be the most important item in hospitals in preparation for a second wave. The most important policy to be implemented at the national level was securing national hospitals designated for the treatment of ID (67.4%). CONCLUSIONS: ID experts in South Korea believe that the COVID-19 pandemic may not be easily controlled and that a second nationwide wave is likely to occur in South Korea. Our results indicate that Korean ID specialists believe that a high level of preparation is needed in various aspects, including the procurement of personal protective equipment, to respond efficiently to a second outbreak."
517,100520200511874,"Abstract E3L is an immediate-early protein of vaccinia virus that is detected within 0.5 hours of infection, potentially before the many immune evasion genes of vaccinia can exert their protective effects. E3L is highly conserved among orthopoxviruses and hence could provide important protective T-cell epitopes that should be retained in any subunit or attenuated vaccine. We have therefore evaluated the immunogenicity of E3L in healthy VV vaccinated donors. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers (n=13) who had previously received a smallpox vaccine (Dryvax®) were activated and expanded using overlapping E3L peptides and their function, specificity and anti-viral activity was analyzed. E3L-specific T-cells were expanded from 7 of 12 (58.3%) vaccinated healthy donors. 25% of these produced CD8+ T-cell responses and 87.5% produced CD4+ T-cells. We identified epitopes restricted by HLA-B35 and HLA-DR15. E3L-specific T-cells killed peptide-loaded target cells as well as vaccinia-infected cells but only CD8+ T-cells could prevent the spread of infectious virus in virus inhibition assays. The epitopes recognized by E3L-specific T-cells were shared with monkeypox and although there was a single amino acid change in the variola epitope homolog, it was recognized by vaccinia-specific T-cells. Therefore it might be important to include E3L in any deletion mutant or subunit vaccine and E3L could provide a useful antigen to monitor protective immunity in humans."
518,10062020062564,"This comment discusses the contribution of population movement to the spread of COVID-19, with a reference to the spread of SARS 17 years ago. We argue that the changing geography of migration, the diversification of jobs taken by migrants, the rapid growth of tourism and business trips, and the longer distance taken by people for family reunion are what make the spread of COVID-19 so differently from that of SARS. These changes in population movement are expected to continue. Hence, new strategies in disease prevention and control should be taken accordingly, which are also proposed in the comment."
519,10122020125164,"BACKGROUND: Understanding the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions remains a critical epidemiological problem in South Africa that reported the largest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths from the African continent. METHODS: In this study, we applied two existing epidemiological models, an extension of the Susceptible-Infected-Removed model (eSIR) and SAPHIRE, to fit the daily ascertained infected (and removed) cases from March 15 to July 31 in South Africa. To combine the desirable features from the two models, we further extended the eSIR model to an eSEIRD model. RESULTS: Using the eSEIRD model, the COVID-19 transmission dynamics in South Africa was characterized by the estimated basic reproduction number (R(0)) at 2.10 (95%CI: [2.09,2.10]). The decrease of effective reproduction number with time implied the effectiveness of interventions. The low estimated ascertained rate was found to be 2.17% (95%CI: [2.15%, 2.19%]) in the eSEIRD model. The overall infection fatality ratio (IFR) was estimated as 0.04% (95%CI: [0.02%, 0.06%]) while the reported case fatality ratio was 4.40% (95% CI: [<0.01%, 11.81%]). As of December 31, 2020, the cumulative number of ascertained cases and total infected would reach roughly 801 thousand and 36.9 million according to the long-term forecasting. CONCLUSIONS: The dynamics based on our models suggested a decline of COVID-19 infection and that the severeness of the epidemic might be largely mitigated through strict interventions. Besides providing insights on the COVID-19 dynamics in South Africa, we develop powerful forecasting tools that allow incorporating ascertained rate and IFR estimation and inquiring into the effect of intervention measures on COVID-19 spread."
520,101320210112941,"INTRODUCTION: Perinatal stroke leads to cerebral palsy (CP) and lifelong disability for thousands of Canadian children. Hemiparesis, referring to impaired functionality in one side of the body, is a common complication of perinatal stroke. Standard long-term care for hemiparetic CP focuses on rehabilitation therapies. Early research suggests that patients with hemiparesis may benefit from adjunctive neuromodulation treatments such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). tDCS uses electric current to stimulate targeted areas of the brain non-invasively, potentially enhancing the effects of motor learning therapies. This protocol describes an economic evaluation to be conducted alongside a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to assess the incremental cost of tDCS added to a camp-based therapy compared with camp-based therapy alone per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained in children with hemiparetic CP. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Stimulation for Perinatal Stroke Optimising Recovery Trajectories (SPORT) trial is a multicentre RCT evaluating tDCS added to a 2-week camp-based therapy for children aged 6–18 years with perinatal ischaemic stroke and disabling hemiparetic CP affecting the upper limb. Outcomes are assessed at baseline, 1 week, 2 months and 6 months following intervention. Cost and quality of life data are collected at baseline and 6 months and results will be used to conduct a cost–utility analysis (CUA). The evaluation will be conducted from the perspectives of the public healthcare system and society. The CUA will be conducted over a 6-month time horizon. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for the SPORT trial and the associated economic evaluation has been given by the research ethics boards at each of the study sites. The findings of the economic evaluation will be submitted for publication in a peer reviewed academic journal and submitted for presentation at conference. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03216837; Post-results."
521,10112020113174,"Most of blood borne and airborne pathogens are highly contagious, harmful and have prevalence among healthcare workers. In this group, healthcare students, especially nursing undergraduates, have even higher risk to be exposed and suffered a contagious accident. One of the main pillars to prevent exposure to such pathogens and decrease accidents seems to be through education. A prospective observational educational research focused on quantifying the students' knowledge, and prevention culture was carried out. The educational approach based on the development of a technological tool, its integration in the students' education, and posterior assessment. The Chi-square, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, Man-Whitney U, and Spearman correlations were used to determine the effect of such educational methodology. The results, previous to the integration of the educational approach, showed differences between the elementary and proficient knowledge and correct procedure in each academic year (p < 0.05), being the best year the third academic year. The mean of elementary knowledge among second year students after the inclusion of the educational methodology improved for 2017/2018 with a mean of 7.5 (1.11) and in 2018/2019 with 7.87 (1.34). This study argued that the educational approach proposed could improve the prevention culture and knowledge among students and future healthcare professionals."
522,10052020054574,"Epidemics of infectious diseases have accompanied humans for a long time and, depending on the scale, cause various undesirable social and economic consequences. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, governments of many countries impose restrictions to inhibit spreading of infection. Isolation and limiting interpersonal contacts are particularly recommended actions. Adhering to the rule of isolation may involve restrictions in freedom during daily activities, such as shopping. The aim of the study was to develop a scale of in-store pandemic behavior. The whole process involved 3 stages: qualitative inquiry, scale purification and scale validation, which were based on 3 studies: 1 qualitative (20 in-depth interviews) 2 two quantitative (373 and 584 respondents, respectively), and allowed to identify 8 factors. Following, a theoretical model was created to investigate the impact of in-store infection threat on identified variables. All identified factors significantly correlated with the in-store infection threat which reiterates the importance of providing information revealing the true scale of the pandemic and not leaving space for individuals to create subjective probability judgments. The developed scale can help counteract disinformation and assess consumer behavior compliance and understanding of the official recommendations imposed by governments, enabling more efficient educational efforts."
523,10172021055362,"Background The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a dramatic crisis in health care systems worldwide. These may have significant implications for the management of cardiometabolic diseases. We conducted a systematic review of published evidence to assess the indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospitalisations for cardiovascular diseases and their management. Methods Studies that evaluated volume of hospitalisations for cardiometabolic conditions and their management with comparisons between the COVID-19 and pre-COVID periods were identified from MEDLINE, Embase and the reference list of relevant studies from January 2020 to 25 February 2021. Results We identified 103 observational studies, with most studies assessing hospitalisations for acute cardiovascular conditions such as acute coronary syndrome, ischemic strokes and heart failure. About 89% of studies reported a decline in hospitalisations during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic times, with reductions ranging from 20.2 to 73%. Severe presentation, less utilization of cardiovascular procedures, and longer patient- and healthcare-related delays were common during the pandemic. Most studies reported shorter length of hospital stay during the pandemic than before the pandemic (1-8 vs 2-12 days) or no difference in length of stay. Most studies reported no change in in-hospital mortality among hospitalised patients. Conclusion Clinical care of patients for acute cardiovascular conditions, their management and outcomes have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients should be educated via population-wide approaches on the need for timely medical contact and health systems should put strategies in place to provide timely care to patients at high risk.

524,10142021025327,"Infodemiological studies derive public health information from internet activity. Here we compare Google searches of perinatal mental health-related terms during the U.K.’s first COVID-19 lockdown with the corresponding period in 2019. We report evidence of reduced pathologising/recognition of perinatal mental illness; increased perceived maternal inadequacy and estrangement from newborn baby; increased maternal domestic abuse; and increased domestic and substance abuse generally. These insights offer important population-level considerations ahead of further U.K. restrictions, and should be imminently confirmed with epidemiological work."
525,10132021013054,"A new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified earlier this year and spread rapidly globally. The clinical manifestations that it produces have gradually become known and the typical clinical picture is respiratory. Although gastrointestinal symptoms have been described in several communications, information on endoscopic findings in these patients is practically zero. We describe two cases of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with COVID-19. In both cases, the presence of gastric ulcers was identified in an unusual location, the gastric fundus. After ruling out malignancy, our suspicion was an ischemic etiology that is consistent with terminal gastric vascularization at the gastric fundus level and increased thrombotic phenomena in patients with COVID-19."
526,10072020079823,"2019-nCoV is a virulent virus belonging to the coronavirus family that caused the new pneumonia (COVID-19) which has spread internationally very rapidly and has become pandemic. In this research paper, we set forward a statistical model called SIR-Poisson that predicts the evolution and the global spread of infectious diseases. The proposed SIR-Poisson model is able to predict the range of the infected cases in a future period. More precisely, it is used to infer the transmission of the COVID-19 in the three Maghreb Central countries (Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco). Using the SIR-Poisson model and based on daily reported disease data, since its emergence until end April 2020, we attempted to predict the future disease period over 60 days. The estimated average number of contacts by an infected individual with others was around 2 for Tunisia and 3 for Algeria and Morocco. Relying on inferred scenarios, although the pandemic situation would tend to decline, it has not ended. From this perspective, the risk of COVID-19 spreading still exists after the deconfinement act. It is necessary, therefore, to carry on the containment until the estimated infected number achieves 0."
527,10152021030095,"To evaluate the effect of different inflation volume on the measurement accuracy of the modified cuff pressure measurement method in different shapes of cuffs, so as to provide reference for the correct monitoring of cuff pressure in clinic. In vitro study: The traditional cuff pressure measurement method (the cuff pressure gauge before measurement shows 0 cm H(2)O) and the modified cuff pressure measurement method (the cuff pressure before measurement shows 25 cm H(2)O, 28 cm H(2)O, 30 cm H(2)O or 32 cm H(2)O) were used to measure cylindrical and tapered cuffs, and the effect of different inflation volume on cuff pressure was analyzed statistically. Clinical study: patients with the artificial airway established by orotracheal intubation or tracheotomy in Neuro-ICU were prospectively selected as subjects, and the measurement procedure was the same as in vitro study. In vitro study showed that the pressure loss values of cylindrical cuff and tapered cuff using the traditional cuff pressure measurement method were (3.75 ± 0.31) cm H(2)O and (4.92 ± 0.44) cm H(2)O, respectively, and clinical study showed that the pressure loss values were (5.07 ± 0.83) cm H(2)O and (5.17 ± 0.93) cm H(2)O, respectively. The actual measured values measured by the traditional cuff pressure measurement method of the two cuff shapes were compared with the corrected target value of 28 cm H(2)O, and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.000). Both in vitro and clinical study had shown that all differences between the actual measured value and the corrected target value using the modified cuff pressure measurement method (measured with 25 cm H(2)O, 30 cm H(2)O, 32 cm H(2)O) were statistically significant (P < 0.000), and the range of overall differences was (0–1.23 ± 0.25) cm H(2)O. In vitro study had shown that the pressure variation coefficient (CV) of the tapered cuff was greater than that of the cylindrical cuff, and the difference was statistically significant (3.08 ± 0.25 VS 2.41 ± 0.21, P < 0.000). The traditional cuff pressure measurement method can directly lead to the cuff pressure drop, which is easy to cause the leakage of secretions on the cuffs and the misjudgment of the cuff pressure by medical personnel. However, the modified cuff pressure measurement method can effectively reduce cuff pressure loss, and taking the actual cuff pressure value as the inflation volume is the highest measurement accuracy.The tapered cuff is more susceptible to air volume, so it is necessary to pay attention to its measurement and correction in clinical practice."
528,10032020030826,"Cervico-vaginal cytology is primarily a cervical cancer screening test. The anatomical continuity of the uterine cavity with the cervix makes the Papanicolaou (Pap) test accessible to evaluate signs of disease shed from the endometrium. Our aim was to determine the sensitivity of routine Pap test in endometrial carcinoma detection and its relationship with clinico-pathologic factors. We performed a systematic review of studies reporting Pap test results prior to diagnosis of or surgery for endometrial carcinoma between 1990 and 2018 in PubMed or Web of Science. Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed study quality using an adapted Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale and Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool. We identified 45 studies including a total of 6599 women with endometrial cancer. Abnormal Pap test results prior to diagnosis of or surgery for endometrial carcinoma were observed in 45% (95% CI, 40%-50%) of study participants. This percentage was significantly higher among those of non-endometrioid histology compared with endometrioid subtypes (77% [95% CI, 66%-87%] vs 44% [95% CI, 34%-53%], respectively; P heterogeneity <.001). Several clinico-pathologic factors were related to a higher percentage of abnormal Pap test results, including high-stage, myometrial invasion >50%, high histological grade, positive peritoneal cytology, presence of lymph node metastasis, cervical involvement, and lymphovascular invasion (P heterogeneity <.05 for all variables). Routine cervical cytology can detect endometrial cancer in almost half of patients, whereas sensitivity is higher among individuals with non-endometrioid histology or more advanced cancers. This review summarizes the current clinical and prognostic value of cervical cytology in endometrial carcinoma. Recent technological developments using molecular biomarkers may improve accuracy for early cancer detection."
529,10162021047967,"BACKGROUND: As mental illness continues to affect 1 in 5 individuals, and the need for support has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, the promise of digital mental health tools remains largely unrealized due to a lack of uptake by patients and providers. Currently, most efforts on supporting the uptake of digital mental health tools remain fragmented across organizations and geography. There is a critical need to synthesize these efforts in order to provide a coordinated strategy of supporting the adoption of digital mental health tools. OBJECTIVE: The specific aim of this project is to develop a web-based resource document to support the engagement of mental health providers and patients in the use of digital mental health tools. METHODS: The web-based resource was developed using a multimethod approach. A grey literature review was conducted in 2019 to identify relevant toolkits that are available in the public domain. This was supplemented with an environmental scan where individuals with expertise in the development, acquisition, implementation, and evaluation of digital mental health tools were invited to contribute additional tools or documents not identified in the grey literature search. An engagement workshop was held with stakeholders to explore how the resource document should be developed and delivered. These findings were collectively used to develop the final iteration of the resource document. RESULTS: Based on a gray literature review and environmental scan with 27 experts, 25 resources were identified and included in the resource guide. These resources were developed for patients and providers by organizations from 5 countries. An engagement workshop was held with 14 stakeholders, and barriers related to cultural sensitivity, sustainability, and accessibility of the toolkit were identified. The final iteration of the resource document was developed by the research team using findings from the gray literature review, environmental scan, and engagement workshop. The contents of the 45-page resource guide are directed at mental health care providers, administrators, and patients (inclusive of families and caregivers). CONCLUSIONS: The use of a multimethod approach led to the development of a resource guide that builds on existing evidence on digital mental health tools and was co-designed with stakeholders and end-users. The resource guide is now publicly available online for free and is being promoted through digital health and mental health websites. Future work should explore how this document can be integrated into clinical care delivery and pathways."

It also studies the various ways in which these models could be depicted using various visualization techniques. This paper aims to present various statistical techniques suggested by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in order to represent the epidemiological data. The main focus of this paper is to analyse how epidemiological data or contagious diseases are theorized using any available information and later may be presented wrongly by not following the guidelines, leading to inaccurate representation and interpretations of the current scenario of the pandemic; with a special reference to the Indian Subcontinent."
531,10152021037922,"BACKGROUND: Decompressive hemicraniectomy (DH) has been performed for some cases of acute ischemic stroke in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, but there is little information about the clinical course and outcomes of these patients. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of a 36-year-old woman with COVID-19 infection who developed stroke like symptoms while under home quarantine. Cranial CT scan showed an acute left internal carotid artery (ICA) infarct. She subsequently underwent an emergent left DH. Despite timely surgical intervention, she succumbed to chronic respiratory failure. A systematic review of SCOPUS and PubMed databases for case reports and case series of patients with COVID-19 infection who similarly underwent a DH for an acute ischemic infarct was performed. There were eight other reported cases in the literature. The patients’ age ranged from 33 to 70 years (mean 48), with a female predilection (2:1). Respiratory preceded neurologic symptoms in 83% of cases. The ICA was the one most commonly involved in the stroke, and the mean NIHSS score was 20. DH was performed at a mean of 1.8 days post-ictus. Only four out of the nine patients were reported alive at the time of writing. The most common cause of death was respiratory failure (60%). CONCLUSION: Clinicians have to be cognizant of the neurovascular complications that may occur during the course of a patient with COVID-19. DH for acute ischemic stroke associated with the said infection was reported in nine patients, but the outcomes were generally poor despite early surgical intervention."
532,10122020123515,"The G/T transversion, rs35705950, located approximately 3 kb upstream of the MUC5B start site, is the cardinal risk factor for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Here, we investigate the function and chromatin structure of this -3 kb region and provide evidence that it functions as a classically defined enhancer subject to epigenetic programming. We use nascent transcript analysis to show that RNA polymerase II loads within 10 bp of the G/T transversion site, definitively establishing enhancer function for the region. By integrating Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) analysis of fresh and cultured human airway epithelial cells with nuclease sensitivity data, we demonstrate that this region is in accessible chromatin that affects the expression of MUC5B. Through applying paired single nucleus RNA- and ATAC-seq to frozen tissue from IPF lungs, we extend these findings directly to disease, with results indicating that epigenetic programming of the -3 kb enhancer in IPF occurs in both MUC5B-expressing and non-expressing lineages. In aggregate, our results indicate that the MUC5B-associated variant, rs35705950, resides within an enhancer that is subject to epigenetic remodeling and contributes to pathologic misexpression in IPF."

This study also compared inflammatory ratios obtained from combinations of six inflammatory markers between the two groups. The risk factors for mortality were identified through logistic regression. RESULTS: Males were 54 (45.8%) and females were 64 (54.2%). Males showed a significant increase in ALT (P = 0.003), CRP (P = 0.03), mean platelet volume (MPV)-to-lymphocyte ratio (P = 0.001), and C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio (P = 0.044), whereas females had a significant increase in lymphocytes (P < 0.005) and MPV (P = 0.01). In all participants, multivariate analysis illustrated that older age, male sex, increased serum total bilirubin, and decreased PO(2) were significant independent predictors of mortality (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In severe COVID-19 patients with diabetes, there were significant sex differences in many laboratory characteristics with a higher risk of mortality among males."
534,10062020064115,"The selection of coarse-grained (CG) mapping operators is a critical step for CG molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. It is still an open question about what is optimal for this choice and there is a need for theory. The current state-of-the art method is mapping operators manually selected by experts. In this work, we demonstrate an automated approach by viewing this problem as supervised learning where we seek to reproduce the mapping operators produced by experts. We present a graph neural network based CG mapping predictor called DEEP SUPERVISED GRAPH PARTITIONING MODEL(DSGPM) that treats mapping operators as a graph segmentation problem. DSGPM is trained on a novel dataset, Human-annotated Mappings (HAM), consisting of 1,206 molecules with expert annotated mapping operators. HAM can be used to facilitate further research in this area. Our model uses a novel metric learning objective to produce high-quality atomic features that are used in spectral clustering. The results show that the DSGPM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the field of graph segmentation."
535,10052020052105,"PURPOSE A highly accurate and robust computer-aided system based on quantitative high-throughput Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) features from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) can drive the success of radiomic applications in breast cancer diagnosis. We aim to build a stable system with highly reproducible radiomics features, which can make diagnostic performance independent of datasets bias and segmentation methods. METHOD We applied a dataset of 267 patients including 136 malignant and 131 benign tumors from two MRI manufacturers, where 211 cases from a Philips system and 55 cases from a GE system. First, manual annotations, 3D-Unet and 2D-Unet were applied as different segmentation methods. Second, we designed and extracted 3172 features from six modalities of DCE-MRI based on BI-RADS. Third, the feature selection was conducted. Between-class distance was utilized to eliminate the effect of dataset bias caused by two machines. Concordance correlation coefficient, intraclass correlation coefficient and deviation were employed to evaluate the influence of three segmentation methods. We further eliminated features redundancy using genetic algorithm. Finally, three classifiers including support vector machine (SVM), the bagged trees and K-Nearest Neighbor were evaluated by their performance for diagnosing malignant and benign tumors. RESULTS A total of 246 features were preserved to have high stability and reproducibility. The final feature set showed the robust performance under these factors and achieved the area under curve of 0.88, the accuracy of 0.824, the sensitivity of 0.844, the specificity of 0.807 in differentiating benign and malignant tumors with the SVM classifier using manually segmentation results. CONCLUSION The final selected 246 features are reproducible and show little dependence on segmentation methods and data perturbation. The high stability and effectiveness of diagnosis across these factors illustrate that the preserved features can be used for prognostic analysis and help radiologists in the diagnosis of breast cancer."
536,10112020115505,"SARS-CoV-2 is the third major coronavirus epidemic to affect humans. There had been multiple instances of patients turning positive after recovering from SARS-2-CoV infection. Though many different theories emerge, false positive RT-PCR is logically the foremost cause and there is a general consensus that during quarantine re-infection from outside seems unlikely when strictly adhered to. As many new strains emerge worldwide during the course of on-going pandemic, the chances of re-infection cannot be ignored as it may contribute to false negative RT-PCR test results. SARS-2-CoV though a novel virus, is phylogenetically similar to SARS-like CoV with around 79% similarity. Studies on immunological response to these infections suggest that antibodies formed after infection confers immunity only for a short period of time before it starts to wane. Also studies on SARS-CoV-2 suggest that antibody formation and longevity of immunity in an individual is dependent on the strain of coronavirus, its severity and age of the person infected. All these considerations demand reviewing the treatment duration, discharge criteria, appropriate use of imaging techniques and importance of risk communication and health education to those recovered."
537,10092020099999,"As of June 2020, the COVID‐19 pandemic has totaled over 9 000 000 cases and 470 000 deaths globally(1). Emerging data from COVID‐19 patients have suggested a clear role for oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of SARS‐CoV‐2, the pathogenic agent of COVID‐19. Several comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and aging, have been associated with an increase in baseline oxidative stress, likely explaining why such individuals at risk for poor outcomes with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Similarly, the concept of oxidative stress remains one of the best supported theories to explain the mechanism behind aging. Oxidative stress through both endogenous and exogenous sources has known deleterious effects in both aging and SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Herein, we will review the role of oxidative stress as a key player in both aging and COVID‐19, and highlight why some individuals may have better or poorer outcomes because of this. Additionally, we will discuss potential therapeutic pathways for effectively anti‐aging as we take away from our learnings on COVID‐19."
538,10082020083918,"Viral infections of the central nervous system (CNS) often cause disease in an age-dependent manner, with greater neuropathology during the fetal and neonatal periods. Transgenic CD46+ mice model these age dependent outcomes through a measles virus infection of CNS neurons. Adult CD46+ mice control viral spread and survive the infection in an interferon gamma (IFNγ)-dependent manner, whereas neonatal CD46+ mice succumb despite similar IFNγ expression in the brain. Thus, we hypothesized that IFNγ signaling in the adult brain may be more robust, potentially due to greater basal expression of IFNγ signaling proteins. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the expression of canonical IFNγ signaling proteins in the neonatal and adult brain, including the IFNγ receptor, Janus kinase (JAK) 1/2, and signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) in the absence of infection. We also analyzed the expression and activation of STAT1 and IFNγ-stimulated genes during MV infection. We found that neonatal brains have equivalent or greater JAK/STAT1 expression in the hippocampus and the cerebellum than adults. IFNγ receptor expression varied by cell type in the brain but was widely expressed on neuronal and glial cells. During MV infection, increased STAT1 expression and activation correlated with viral load in the hippocampus regardless of age, but not in the cerebellum where viral load was consistently undetectable in adults. These results suggest the neonatal brain is capable of initiating IFNγ signaling during a viral infection, but that downstream STAT1 activation is insufficient to limit viral spread."
539,101320210112799,"Objective. Using a pandemic influenza model modified for COVID-19, this study investigated the degree of control over pre-symptomatic transmission that common non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) would require to reduce the spread in long-term care facilities. Methods. We created a stochastic compartmental SEIR model with Poisson-distributed transition states that compared the effect of R0, common NPIs, and isolation rates of pre-symptomatic carriers primarily on attack rate, peak cases, and timing in a 200-resident nursing home. Model sensitivity was assessed with 1st order Sobol' indices. Results. The most rigorous NPIs decreased the peak number of infections by 4.3 and delayed the peak by 9.7 days in the absence of pre-symptomatic controls. Reductions in attack rate were not likely, even with rigorous application of all defined NPIs, unless pre-symptomatic carriers were identified and isolated at rates exceeding 76%. Attack rate was most sensitive to the pre-symptomatic isolation rate (Sobol' index > 0.7) and secondarily to R0. Conclusions. Common NPIs delayed and reduced epidemic peaks. Reducing attack rates ultimately required efficient isolation of pre-symptomatic cases, including rapid antigen tests on a nearly daily basis. This must be accounted for in testing and contact tracing plans for group living settings."
540,10092020090003,"BACKGROUND: Apparent Young’s modulus (AYM), which reflects the fundamental mechanical property of live cells measured by atomic force microscopy and is determined by substrate stiffness regulated cytoskeletal organization, has been investigated as potential indicators of cell fate in specific cell types. However, applying biophysical cues, such as modulating the substrate stiffness, to regulate AYM and thereby reflect and/or control stem cell lineage specificity for downstream applications, remains a primary challenge during in vitro stem cell expansion. Moreover, substrate stiffness could modulate cell heterogeneity in the single-cell stage and contribute to cell fate regulation, yet the indicative link between AYM and cell fate determination during in vitro dynamic cell expansion (from single-cell stage to multi-cell stage) has not been established. RESULTS: Here, we show that the AYM of cells changed dynamically during passaging and proliferation on substrates with different stiffness. Moreover, the same change in substrate stiffness caused different patterns of AYM change in epithelial and mesenchymal cell types. Embryonic stem cells and their derived progenitor cells exhibited distinguishing AYM changes in response to different substrate stiffness that had significant effects on their maintenance of pluripotency and/or lineage-specific characteristics. On substrates that were too rigid or too soft, fluctuations in AYM occurred during cell passaging and proliferation that led to a loss in lineage specificity. On a substrate with ‘optimal’ stiffness (i.e., 3.5 kPa), the AYM was maintained at a constant level that was consistent with the parental cells during passaging and proliferation and led to preservation of lineage specificity. The effects of substrate stiffness on AYM and downstream cell fate were correlated with intracellular cytoskeletal organization and nuclear/cytoplasmic localization of YAP. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, this study suggests that optimal substrate stiffness regulated consistent AYM during passaging and proliferation reflects and contributes to hESCs and their derived progenitor cells lineage specificity maintenance, through the underlying mechanistic pathways of stiffness-induced cytoskeletal organization and the downstream YAP signaling. These findings highlighted the potential of AYM as an indicator to select suitable substrate stiffness for stem cell specificity maintenance during in vitro expansion for regenerative applications."
541,101620210411374,"This study aimed to analyze the discourses of patients who were diagnosed with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, the perception of why they acquired this health condition and barriers to seeking care in a priority city in Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was an exploratory qualitative study, which used the theoretical-methodological framework of the Discourse Analysis of French matrix, guided by the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research. The study was conducted in Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Brazil. Seven participants were interviewed who were undergoing treatment at the time of the interview. The analysis of the participants’ discourses allowed the emergence of four discursive blocks: (1) impact of the social determinants in the development of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, (2) barriers to seeking care and difficulties accessing health services, (3) perceptions of the side effects and their impact on multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment, and (4) tuberculosis and COVID-19: a necessary dialogue. Through discursive formations, these revealed the determinants of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Considering the complexity involved in the dynamics of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, advancing in terms of equity in health, that is, in reducing unjust differences, is a challenge for public policies, especially at the current moment in Brazil, which is of accentuated economic, political and social crisis. The importance of psychosocial stressors and the lack of social support should also be highlighted as intermediary determinants of health. The study has also shown the situation of COVID-19, which consists of an important barrier for patients seeking care. Many patients reported fear, insecurity and worry with regard to returning to medical appointments, which might contribute to the worsening of tuberculosis in the scenario under study."

543,101520210310938,"Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic, some K-12 schools resumed in-person classes with varying degrees of mitigation plans in the fall of 2020. Physical distancing and face coverings can minimize SARS-CoV-2 spread, the virus that causes COVID-19. However, no research has focused on mitigation strategy adherence during school days. Thus, we sought to develop a systematic observation protocol to capture COVID-19 mitigation strategy adherence in school environments: The Systematic Observation of COVID-19 Mitigation (SOCOM). Methods: We extended previously validated and internationally used tools to develop the SOCOM training and implementation protocol to assess physical distancing and face covering behaviors. SOCOM was tested in diverse indoor and outdoor settings (classrooms, lunchrooms, physical education [PE], and recess) among diverse schools (elementary, secondary, and special needs). Results: For the unique metrics of physical-distancing and face-covering behaviors, areas with more activity and a maximum of 10-15 students were ideal for accurately capturing data. Overall proportion of agreement was high for physical distancing (90.9%), face covering (88.6%), activity type (89.2%), and physical activity level (87.9%). Agreement was lowest during active recess, PE, and observation areas with [≥]20 students. Conclusions: Millions of children throughout the US are likely to return to school in the months ahead despite the current surge of COVID-19 cases. SOCOM is a relatively inexpensive tool that can be implemented by schools to determine mitigation strategy adherence and assess changes to protocols to help students return to school safely and slow the spread of COVID-19 and can be used for research purposes."

CT paranasal sinus and MRI brain revealed left-sided pansinusitis with acute infarct in the left parieto-occipital region without angioinvasion. An emergency functional endoscopic sinus procedure was done, which confirmed mucormycosis on histopathological examination. After 1 week of conventional amphotericin B and antibiotics, repeat CT brain showed improvement in mucosal thickening and sinusitis. This case is a rare presentation of mucormycosis associated with rapid progression to orbital apex syndrome with brain infarction in a patient with non-ketotic diabetes and COVID-19.

550,101120201110736,"Introduction Covid-19 is associated with a high risk of venous thromboembolism. In addition, cases of arterial thromboembolism were also reported. We investigated the effect of antiplatelet therapy on the disease course. Methods We evaluated a cohort of inpatients with Covid-19 (n = 152). We recorded the patient’s demographic data, their comorbidities, medication use including the use of antiplatelets and anticoagulants, laboratory findings and data about mechanical ventilation. We then separated the patient’s outcomes into either being „bad“ (dead or referral to higher level of care) or „good“ (discharged). Then we evaluated the factors that contributed to the patient needing ventilatory support and to showing typical radiological findings. Results In our cohort, 21 patients received ventilatory support whereas 131 did not require the use of ventilators. 127 patients had good outcomes and 25 had bad outcomes. By using multivariate analysis, we found that the need for ventilatory support was the strongest predictor of a bad outcome. All patients who were on ventilators displayed typical radiological findings. The factors predicting the need for ventilatory support were LDH and CRP levels, the presence of cardiac conduction abnormalities as well as chronic lung conditions. Cardiac conduction abnormalities, LDH and CRP levels, and the use of antiplatelets, were factors that predicted typical radiological findings. Conclusions There was a higher incidence of typical radiological findings in patients on antiplatelet medication. However, it did not translate into changes in the ventilation requirement or in the outcome. The need for mechanical ventilation was the strongest predictor of a bad outcome."

552,10112020113160,"INTRODUCTION Owing to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak Hong Kong hospitals have suspended visiting periods and made mask wearing mandatory. In obstetrics, companionship during childbirth has been suspended and prenatal exercises, antenatal talks, hospital tours, and postnatal classes have been cancelled. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of these restrictive measures on delivery plans and risks of postpartum depression. METHODS We compared pregnancy data and the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) scores of women who delivered between the pre-alert period (1 Jan 2019 to 4 Jan 2020) and post-alert period (5 Jan 2020 to 30 Apr 2020) in a tertiary university public hospital in Hong Kong. Screening for postpartum depression was performed routinely using the EPDS questionnaire 1 day and within 1 week after delivery. RESULTS There was a 13.1% reduction in the number of deliveries between 1 January and 30 April from 1144 in 2019 to 994 in 2020. The EPDS scores were available for 4357 out of 4531 deliveries (96.2%). A significantly higher proportion of women had EPDS scores of ≥10 1 day after delivery in the post-alert group than the pre-alert group (14.4% vs 11.9%; P<0.05). More women used pethidine (6.2% vs 4.6%) and fewer used a birthing ball (8.5% vs 12.4%) for pain relief during labour in the post-alert group. CONCLUSIONS Pregnant women reported more depressive symptoms in the postpartum period following the alert announcement regarding coronavirus infection in Hong Kong. This was coupled with a drop in the delivery rate at our public hospital. Suspension of childbirth companionship might have altered the methods of intrapartum pain relief and the overall pregnancy experience."
553,10052020054560,"Usage of a face mask has become mandatory in many countries after the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, and its usefulness in combating the pandemic is a proven fact. There have been many advancements in the design of a face mask and the present treatise describes a face mask in which a simple textile triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) serves the purpose of filtration of SARS-CoV-2. The proposed mask is designed with multilayer protection sheets, in which the first two layers act as triboelectric (TE) filter and the outer one is a smart filter. The conjugated effect of contact electrification, and electrostatic induction of the proposed smart mask are effective in inactivating the span of virus-ladden aerosols in a bidirectional way. Five pairs of triboseries fabrics i.e. nylon - polyester, cotton - polyester, poly(methyl methacrylate) - PVDF, lylon - PVDF and polypropylene - polyester have been optimized in this study in terms of their effective tribo-electric charge densities as 83.13, 211.48, 38.62, 69 and 74.25 nC/m2, respectively. This smart mask can be used by a wide range of people because of its simple mechanism, self-driven (harvesting mechanical energy from daily activities, e.g. breathing, talking, or other facial movements functionalities, and effective filtration efficiency and thus, it is expected to be potentially beneficial to slow down the devastating impact of COVID-19."
554,101320210112955,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus is causing COVID-19, an ongoing pandemic, with extraordinary global health, social, and political implications. Currently, extensive research and development efforts are aimed at producing a safe and effective vaccine. In the interim, small molecules are being widely investigated for antiviral effects. With respect to viral replication, the papain-like (PL(pro)) and main proteases (M(pro)), are critical for processing viral replicase polypeptides. Further, the PL(pro) possesses deubiquitinating activity affecting key signalling pathways, including inhibition of interferon and innate immune antagonism. Therefore, inhibition of PL(pro) activity with small molecules is an important research direction. Our aim was to focus on identification of potential inhibitors of the protease activity of SARS-CoV-2 PL(pro). We investigated 300 small compounds derived predominantly from our OliveNet(TM) library (222 phenolics) and supplemented with synthetic and dietary compounds with reported antiviral activities. An initial docking screen, using the potent and selective noncovalent PL(pro) inhibitor, GRL-0617 as a control, enabled a selection of 30 compounds for further analyses. From further in silico analyses, including docking to scenes derived from a publicly available molecular dynamics simulation trajectory (100μs PDB 6WX4; DESRES-ANTON-11441075), we identified lead compounds for further in vitro evaluation using an enzymatic inhibition assay measuring SARS-CoV-2 PL(pro) protease activity. Our findings indicate that hypericin possessed inhibition activity, and both rutin and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of the PL(pro), with activity in the micromolar range. Overall, hypericin, rutin, and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside can be considered lead compounds requiring further characterisation for potential antiviral effects in appropriate model systems."

557,10172021052419,"BACKGROUND Gynecological Teaching Associates (GTAs) and Male Urogenital Teaching Associates (MUTAs) are individuals trained to instruct health professional learners with their own body to conduct accurate, patient-centered breast, pelvic, urogenital, rectal, and/or prostate examinations. Evidence indicates that this results in improvements in technical competence and communication skills, but there is wide variability to how such programs are implemented and engaged within the curriculum. In this scoping review, we mapped evidence regarding (1) how GTA/MUTA programs are utilized with health professional learners, (2) how GTA/MUTA programs are implemented using the Association of Standardized Patient Educators (ASPE) Standards of Best Practice (SOBP) as a framework, and (3) what broad outcomes are addressed in publications. METHODS PubMed, ERIC, PsychINFO, CINAHL, and Sociological Abstracts were searched for all publications addressing instruction of physical examinations with a GTA/MUTA and/or administration of GTA/MUTA programs. Studies were charted in tandem until consensus was identified and then charted individually, using an iterative process. The scoping review protocol was registered prospectively. RESULTS One hundred and one articles were identified, and nearly all highlighted positive results regarding GTA/MUTA programs. Most studies addressed medical students within the USA and Europe. During instructional sessions, three (SD=1.4) learners worked with each GTA/MUTA and an average of 32 min (SD=17) was allocated per learner. GTAs/MUTA instructed both independently (n=33) and in pairs (n=51). Thirty-eight articles provided detailed information consistent with one or more of the Domains of the ASPE SOBP, with six providing specific information regarding safe work environments. CONCLUSIONS While studies demonstrate consistently positive outcomes for learners, there is wide variability in implementation patterns. This variability may impact learning outcomes and impact both physical and psychological safety for GTAs/MUTAs and learners. Terminology used to refer to GTAs/MUTAs is inconsistent and may obscure relevant publications. Additional research is indicated to explore the pedagogical variables that result in positive learning outcomes and examine methods to ensure physical and psychological safety of GTAs/MUTAs and learners.

Although the health stakes are higher for older adults, individuals of all ages should adopt preventive measures to contain the human-to-human transmission of the virus. This study conducted a national online survey of 1843 adults at the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. to examine age disparities in preventive behaviors against the virus. The results show that older generations, motivated by a higher perceived severity of the disease, were more likely to take the precautionary actions recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) than younger generations. This thus suggests that persuasive health messages addressing the severity of COVID-19 might reduce the generational gap and promote preventive behaviors among young people, to protect themselves and the elderly."

563,10032020030832,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and the disease it causes, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is generating a rapid and tragic health emergency in Italy due to the need to provide assistance to an overwhelming number of infected patients and, at the same time, treat all the non-deferrable oncological and benign conditions. A panel of Italian urologists has agreed on possible strategies for the reorganization of urological routine practice and on a set of recommendations that should facilitate the process of rescheduling both surgical and outpatient activities during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the subsequent phases. This document could be a valid tool to be used in routine clinical practice and, possibly, a cornerstone for further discussion on the topic also considering the further evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. It also may provide useful recommendations for national and international urological societies in a condition of emergency."
564,10152021030081,"PURPOSE: To quantify potential heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE), of early sedation with dexmedetomidine (DEX) compared with usual care, and identify patients who have a high probability of lower or higher 90-day mortality according to age, and other identified clusters. METHODS: Bayesian analysis of 3904 critically ill adult patients expected to receive invasive ventilation > 24 h and enrolled in a multinational randomized controlled trial comparing early DEX with usual care sedation. RESULTS: HTE was assessed according to age and clusters (based on 12 baseline characteristics) using a Bayesian hierarchical models. DEX was associated with lower 90-day mortality compared to usual care in patients > 65 years (odds ratio [OR], 0.83 [95% credible interval [CrI] 0.68–1.00], with 97.7% probability of reduced mortality across broad categories of illness severity. Conversely, the probability of increased mortality in patients ≤ 65 years was 98.5% (OR 1.26 [95% CrI 1.02–1.56]. Two clusters were identified: cluster 1 (976 patients) mostly operative, and cluster 2 (2346 patients), predominantly non-operative. There was a greater probability of benefit with DEX in cluster 1 (OR 0.86 [95% CrI 0.65–1.14]) across broad categories of age, with 86.4% probability that DEX is more beneficial in cluster 1 than cluster 2. CONCLUSION: In critically ill mechanically ventilated patients, early sedation with dexmedetomidine exhibited a high probability of reduced 90-day mortality in older patients regardless of operative or non-operative cluster status. Conversely, a high probability of increased 90-day mortality was observed in younger patients of non-operative status. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

565,10092020091309,"A comparison of student learning in a critical thinking exercise for technology decision-making occurred with the onset of coronavirus and the switch from face-to-face to distance with Zoom. Literature on explicit critical thinking skill sets is scant in any format, including distance learning. While face-to-face and Zoom have similarities, seizing this opportunity for comparison can set the stage to determine soundness of distance learning in critical thinking on a preliminary basis. The learning outcome, learning guide and assessment instrument remained the same for the exercise in both formats; student teams presented analyses of different technologies with assessment by 2 faculty as before. Forty students had not completed the exercise when the coronavirus shut down occurred. Students performed at as high a level using virtual/Zoom as with face-to-face."
566,10072020079837,"BACKGROUND: The rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared as an emerging public health threat by the World Health Organization. As various measures have been taken successfully to combat the epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, a growing number of fully recovered patients have been discharged from hospitals. However, some of them have relapsed. Little is known about the causes that triggered the relapse. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 40 years old man who suffered from recurrent pulmonary infection with progression of lesions on chest computed tomography (CT), elevated levels of ferritin and IL2R, reduced lymphocyte count and positive oropharyngeal swab test for SARS-CoV-2 again after 5 days discharge from hospital. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody level of this patient was very low at the time of relapse, suggesting a weak humoral immune response to the virus. Total exon sequencing revealed mutations in TRNT1 gene, which may be responsible for B cell immunodeficiency. Therefore, uncleared SARS-CoV-2 at his first discharge was likely to lead to his recurrence. However, viral superinfection and non-infectious organizing pneumonia could not be completely excluded. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 relapse may occur in a part of discharged patients with low titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. These patients should be maintained in isolation for longer time even after discharge. A more sensitive method to detect SARS-CoV-2 needs to be established and serological testing for specific antibodies may be used as a reference to determine the duration of isolation."

568,10052020052111,"BACKGROUND Documentation burden, defined as the need to complete unnecessary documentation elements in the electronic health record (EHR), is significant for nurses and contributes to decreased time with patients as well as burnout. Burden increases when new documentation elements are added, but unnecessary elements are not systematically identified and removed. OBJECTIVES Reducing the burden of nursing documentation during the inpatient admission process was a key objective for a group of nurse experts who collaboratively identified essential clinical data elements to be documented by nurses in the EHR. METHODS Twelve health care organizations used a data-driven process to evaluate inpatient admission assessment data elements to identify which elements were consistently deemed essential to patient care. Processes used for the twelve organizations to reach consensus included identifying: (1) data elements that were truly essential, (2) which data elements were explicitly required during the admission process, and (3) data elements that must be documented by a registered nurse (RN). RESULT The result was an Admission Patient History Essential Clinical Dataset (APH ECD) that reduced the amount of admission documentation content by an average of 48.5%. Early adopters experienced an average reduction of more than two minutes per admission history documentation session and an average reduction in clicks of more than 30%. CONCLUSION The creation of the essential clinical dataset is an example of combining evidence from nursing practice within the EHR with a set of predefined guiding principles to decrease documentation burden for nurses. Establishing essential documentation components for the adult admission history and intake process ensures the efficient use of bedside nurses' time by collecting the right (necessary) information collected by the right person at the right time during the patient's hospital stay. Determining essential elements also provides a framework for mapping components to national standards to facilitate shareable and comparable nursing data."
569,10112020115511,"BACKGROUND: Intensive care unit workers are at high risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection, especially when performing invasive techniques and certain procedures that generate aerosols (< 5 μm). Therefore, one of the objectives of the health systems should implement safety practices to minimize the risk of contagion among these health professionals. Monitoring environmental contamination of SARS-CoV-2 may help to determine the potential of the environment as a transmission medium in an area highly exposed to SARS-CoV-2, such as an intensive care unit. The objective of the study was to analyze the environmental contamination by SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces collected in an intensive care unit, which is dedicated exclusively to the care of patients with COVID-19 and equipped with negative pressure of – 10 Pa and an air change rate of 20 cycles per hour. Furthermore, all ICU workers were tested for COVID-19 by quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA methods. RESULTS: A total of 102 samples (72 collected with pre-moistened swabs used for collection of nasopharyngeal exudates and 30 with moistened wipes used in the environmental microbiological control of the food industry) were obtained from ventilators, monitors, perfusion pumps, bed rails, lab benches, containers of personal protective equipment, computer keyboards and mice, telephones, workers’ shoes, floor, and other areas of close contact with COVID-19 patients and healthcare professionals who cared for them. The analysis by quantitative RT-PCR showed no detection of SARS-CoV-2 genome in environmental samples collected by any of the two methods described. Furthermore, none of the 237 ICU workers was infected by the virus. CONCLUSIONS: Presence of SARS-CoV-2 on the ICU surfaces could not be determined supporting that a strict cleaning protocol with sodium hypochlorite, a high air change rate, and a negative pressure in the ICU are effective in preventing environmental contamination. These facts together with the protection measures used could also explain the absence of contagion among staff inside ICUs."
570,10122020123501,"OBJECTIVE Determine if antibiotic prescribing patterns differ for in-person versus virtual clinic visits for acute rhinosinusitis (ARS). METHODS All adult virtual clinical encounters from March-May 2020 with a principal diagnosis of ARS were reviewed for demographic data and the presence or absence of an antibiotic prescription during the coronavirus shut down in Massachusetts. In-person clinical encounters from March-May 2019 were similarly examined as a control. The rate of antibiotic prescription was compared between virtual (2020) and in-person (2019) visits for ARS diagnoses. RESULTS There were 2,075 patients in March-May 2020 and 3,654 patients March-May 2019 who received an ARS principal diagnosis at their virtual and in-person outpatient visits, respectively. There was a statistically significant lower rate of antibiotic prescriptions for ARS in 2020 (72.1%) versus 2019 (76.7%).The odds ratio for an antibiotic prescription for ARS was 0.783 (95% confidence interval, 0.693-0.86; p < 0.001) for patients seen in the 2020 cohort versus the 2019 cohort. The compared rates for antibiotic prescribing for 2020 versus 2019 were not different in individual month-to-month comparisons. When stratified by otolaryngology providers there was no statistically significant difference of antibiotic prescriptions between the 2019 and 2020 cohort (p = 0.781). CONCLUSION During the massive transition to virtual visits for March-May 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic shut down in Massachusetts, the total rate of outpatient antibiotic prescribing for ARS was lower in the virtual visit environment compared to the traditional in-person visit. In this scenario, telemedicine did not result in an increase in antibiotic prescribing despite the lack of an in-person physical exam. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

572,10152021037936,"Several applications, where extreme conditions occur, require the use of alloys often containing many critical elements. Due to the ever increasing prices of critical raw materials (CRMs) linked to their high supply risk, and because of their fundamental and large utilization in high tech products and applications, it is extremely important to find viable solutions to save CRMs usage. Apart from increasing processes’ efficiency, substitution, and recycling, one of the alternatives to preserve an alloy and increase its operating lifetime, thus saving the CRMs needed for its manufacturing, is to protect it by a suitable coating or a surface treatment. This review presents the most recent trends in coatings for application in high temperature alloys for aerospace engines. CRMs’ current and future saving scenarios in the alloys and coatings for the aerospace engine are also discussed. The overarching aim of this paper is to raise awareness on the CRMs issue related to the alloys and coating for aerospace, suggesting some mitigation measures without having the ambition nor to give a complete overview of the topic nor a turnkey solution."

574,10062020064101,"Digital contact tracing and analysis of social distancing from smartphone location data are two prime examples of non-therapeutic interventions used in many countries to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. While many understand the importance of trading personal privacy for the public good, others have been alarmed at the potential for surveillance via measures enabled through location tracking on smartphones. In our research, we analyzed massive yet atomic individual-level location data containing over 22 billion records from ten Blue (Democratic) and ten Red (Republican) cities in the U.S., based on which we present, herein, some of the first evidence of how Americans responded to the increasing concerns that government authorities, the private sector, and public health experts might use individual-level location data to track the COVID-19 spread. First, we found a significant decreasing trend of mobile-app location-sharing opt-out. Whereas areas with more Democrats were more privacy-concerned than areas with more Republicans before the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant decrease in the overall opt-out rates after COVID-19, and this effect was more salient among Democratic than Republican cities. Second, people who practiced social distancing (i.e., those who traveled less and interacted with fewer close contacts during the pandemic) were also less likely to opt-out, whereas the converse was true for people who practiced less social-distancing. This relationship also was more salient among Democratic than Republican cities. Third, high-income populations and males, compared with low-income populations and females, were more privacy-conscientious and more likely to opt-out of location tracking."
575,10162021047973,"BACKGROUND: A recent study showed that the ABO gene, chr 9q34.2, which determines blood type, may affect COVID-19 disease severity, although this result has not been reproducible. A UK study of 2200 COVID-19 patients found no relationship of ABO blood type to disease severity. A Danish study identified ABO blood group as a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection but not for hospitalization or death from COVID-19. AIM: In the current study, we wished to analyze the relationship of ABO blood group and the ABO genetic locus to COVID-19 test positivity and mortality in subjects from the UK Biobank (UKB). METHODS: ABO blood type is from UKB data field 23165. Blood type was imputed for genotyped UK Biobank participants using three SNPs (rs505922, rs8176719, and rs8176746) in the ABO gene on chromosome 9q34.2. We analyzed the chromosome 9 snp rs657152 to assess the relationship of the ABO locus to COVID-19 test positivity and mortality. RESULTS: COVID-19 test results (negative or positive) were not related to blood group in males (p = 0.977, two tailed Fisher exact test) or females (p = 0.548). COVID-19 outcomes (alive or died) were not related to blood group in males (p = 0.102, two tailed Fisher exact test) or females (p = 0.226). We found no significant relationship of rs657152 to COVID-19 test positivity or mortality. CONCLUSION: We were not able to confirm that ABO blood group influences risk of COVID-19 infection or outcome."
576,101620210411360,"With the regulatory approval of Provenge and Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer and advanced melanoma respectively, and other promising clinical trials outcomes, cancer vaccine is gaining prominence as a cancer therapeutic agent. Cancer vaccine works to induce T cell priming, expansion, and infiltration resulting in antigen-specific cytotoxicity. Such an approach that can drive cytotoxicity within the tumor could complement the success of checkpoint inhibitors as tumors shown to have high immune cell infiltration are those that would respond well to these antibodies. With the advancements in cancer vaccine, methods to monitor and understand how cancer vaccines modify the immune milieu is under rapid development. This includes using ELISpot and intracellular staining to detect cytokine secretion by activated T cells; tetramer and CyTOF to quantitate the level of antigen specific T cells; proliferation and cell killing assay to detect the expansion of T cell and specific killing activity. More recently, T cell profiling has provided unprecedented detail on immune cell subsets and providing clues to the mechanism involved in immune activation. Here, we reviewed cancer vaccines currently in clinical trials and highlight available techniques in monitoring the clinical response in patients."
577,10092020090017,"INTRODUCTION: Proper insulin injection technique has demonstrated positive clinical outcomes in patients with diabetes. A Canadian-based practice reflective was undertaken to evaluate the current state of understanding of injection technique practices by patients administering insulin, and the importance physicians place on proper injection technique. METHODS: Twenty-four sites across Canada completed a practice profile survey and enrolled adult non-pregnant patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes injecting insulin using an insulin pen. Seven areas of proper injection technique to be evaluated were identified by the study steering committee: size of injection site, use of a skin lift, needle reuse, length of the needle, duration of the needle in the skin, injection into lipohypertrophic tissue, and applied injection force. During a scheduled visit, each patient filled out the Injection Technique Survey and the physician documented the answers via an electronic database. RESULTS: Almost all physicians surveyed agreed (96%) that proper insulin injection technique is important or very important and 80% indicated they were either completely confident or fairly confident in discussing overall insulin injection technique. All patients surveyed were making at least one insulin injection technique error within the following categories: applied injection force (76%), area size of injection site (64%), duration of pen needle in skin (61%), pen needle reuse (39%), performs a skin lift with a 4 or 5 mm needle (38%), uses a longer pen needle than required (34%), and injection of insulin into lipohypertrophic tissue (37%). CONCLUSION: Patients commonly make insulin injection errors. Patient and physician education on optimal insulin injection technique continues to be an unmet medical need for the treatment of patients with diabetes. Prospective trials examining the impact of new technology, diabetes educational teams, and e-learning as educational interventions are potential avenues to explore in future studies to support improved insulin injection technique.

578,100820200811123,"BACKGROUND: Recently a severe form of COVID-19 infection has been described in a cluster of children presenting as multisystem inflammatory condition. One of the important spectrum of this condition is incomplete Kawasaki disease (KD). CASE REPORT: A 5-month-old male child presented with high-spiking fever for 5 days with skin rash, bilateral non-purulent conjunctivitis and irritability. His C-reactive protein was markedly elevated (215.4 mg/l). Echocardiography revealed dilated left main coronary artery (3.0 mm, Z score +4.30) and left anterior descending artery (2.37 mm, Z score +3.76). Concomitantly Reverse Transcription- Polymerase Chain Reaction for COVID-19 was positive on fifth day sample. He was diagnosed as incomplete KD with COVID-19 infection and treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (2 g/kg), oral aspirin and azithromycin. Patient improved after 48 h and was discharged on oral aspirin. CONCLUSION: Incomplete KD may co-exist with COVID-19 infection in infant. Early institution of IVIG may lead to better outcome."
579,101020201011014,"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought science into the public eye and to the attention of governments more than ever before. Much of this attention is on work in epidemiology, virology, and public health, with most behavioural advice in public health focussing squarely on ‘proximate’ determinants of behaviour. While epidemiological models are powerful tools to predict the spread of disease when human behaviour is stable, most do not incorporate behavioural change. The evolutionary basis of our preferences and the cultural evolutionary dynamics of our beliefs drive behavioural change, so understanding these evolutionary processes can help inform individual and government decision-making in the face of a pandemic."

581,10132021015431,"The promise of efficacious vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is fulfilled and vaccination campaigns are starting worldwide. However, the fight against the pandemic is far from over. Here, we propose an age-structured compartmental model to study the interplay of disease transmission, vaccines rollout, and behavioural dynamics. We investigate, via in-silico simulations, individual and societal behavioural changes, possibly induced by the start of the vaccination campaigns, and manifested as a relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions. We calibrate the model using real epidemiological data for three different countries: Italy, France, and the United Kingdom. We explore different vaccination rollout speeds, prioritization strategies, and vaccine efficacy as well as multiple behavioural responses. Our findings suggest that early relaxation of safe behaviours can jeopardize the benefits brought by the vaccine in the short term: a fast vaccine distribution and policies aimed at keeping high compliance of individual safe behaviours are key to mitigate disease resurgence."
582,101120201110722,"BACKGROUND: While the results of previous meta-analyses have shown beneficial effects of corticosteroid therapy on post-extubation stridor and extubation failure in adults, these results might not be generalizable to children because of the differences in anatomy and structure. We aimed to determine the benefits of corticosteroids on those outcomes in pediatric populations. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and reference lists of articles from inception until February 2019. Randomized controlled trials and observational studies on the efficacy of systemic corticosteroid administration given prior to elective extubation in mechanically ventilated pediatrics were eligible. Outcomes included post-extubation stridor indicating laryngeal edema and extubation failures. RESULTS: A total of ten randomized controlled trials with 591 pediatric patients were included: seven of the ten studies for post-extubation stridor/suspected upper airway obstruction and nine of the ten studies for extubation failure. The estimate of pooled odds ratios (ORs) for post-extubation stridor/suspected upper airway obstruction was 0.40 (95% CI: 0.21–0.79). When analysis was restricted to trials that had explicit data for infants and explicit data for pediatric patients under 5 years old excluding infants, the estimates of pooled ORs were 0.53 (95% CI: 0.20–1.40) and 0.68 (95% CI: 0.38–1.22), respectively. For pediatric patients who received corticosteroids, there was a 0.37-fold lower odds of extubation failure than that in pediatric patients who did not receive corticosteroids (OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.22–0.61). While three observational studies were included in this review, their estimates have a potential for bias and we did not perform a meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a relatively small sample size in each randomized controlled trial and wide ranges of ages and steroid administration regimens, our results suggest that the use of corticosteroids for prevention of post-extubation stridor and extubation failure could be considered to be acceptable in pediatric patients."
583,100920200910615,"Recently, during the pandemic infection of the novel SARS-CoV-2, some cases of Guillan-Barré Syndrome (GBS) have been reported. The aim of this work is to report the natural history of patients with GBS, both COVID and not-COVID related, hospitalized in Liguria region, during lock down period, in order to assess clinical features of both groups and possible managements pitfalls due to pandemic emergency. Fifteen GBS patients were admitted to the Hospitals of Liguria, from February 15th to May 3rd 2020, six with SARS-CoV-2 infection and nine without infection. In COVID-19 related GBS five patients presented with classical GBS and one with variant. Two patients presented neurologic symptoms during or shortly after the viral syndrome, suggesting the pattern of a para-infectious profile. Multi-organ involvement, delay in the diagnosis, incomplete work up and start of therapy, were registered in 50% of cases with a GBS-Disability scale ≥4 at follow-up evaluation. In not-COVID-19 related GBS, main problem was diagnostic delay. In three patients the first neurological observation took place after a mean of 33,6 days. Moreover, five patients went to emergency room after an average of 30 days since the onset of neurological symptoms because of fear of contagion. In conclusion, not only SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause GBS, but it can also, due to effects of pandemic on the health organization, affect the outcome of patients with not COVID-19 related GBS."
584,10142021023742,"ObjectivesTo review and synthesize the existing evidence on bereavement care, within the United Kingdom (UK), for ethnic minority communities in terms of barriers and facilitators to access; models of care; outcomes from, and satisfaction with, service provision. DesignA systematic review adopting a framework synthesis approach was conducted. An electronic search of the literature was undertaken in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Social Work Abstract and CINAHL via EBSCO, Global Health, Cochrane library, the Trip database and ProQuest between 2000 and 2020. Search terms included bereavement care, ethnic minority populations and the UK setting. ResultsFrom 3,185 initial records, following screening for eligibility, and full-text review of 164 articles, seven studies were identified. There was no research literature outlining the role of family, friends and existing networks; and a real absence of evidence about outcomes and levels of satisfaction for those from an ethnic minority background who receive bereavement care. From the limited literature, the overarching theme for barriers to bereavement care was unfamiliarity and irregularities. Four identified subthemes were lack of awareness; variability in support; type and format of support; and culturally specific beliefs. The overarching theme for facilitators for bereavement care was accessibility with the two subthemes being readily available information and inclusive approaches. Three studies reported on examples of different models of care provision. ConclusionsThis review reveals a stark lack of evidence about bereavement care for ethnic minority populations. In particular, understanding more about the role of family, friends and existing support systems, alongside outcomes and satisfaction will begin to develop the evidence base underpinning current provision. Direct user-representation through proactive engagement and co-design approaches may begin to determine the most appropriate models and format of bereavement care for ethnic minority communities to inform service design and delivery."
585,10162021049786,"PURPOSE: During the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the activity of Emergency Departments worldwide changed dramatically, focusing on diagnosis and care of the Sars-Cov-2 associated disease. These major changes also involved the activity of the Emergency Radiology Department (ERD). This study aimed to analyse the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on imaging studies, both in terms of the amount, frequency and subspecialty of different imaging modalities requested to the ERD of the Maggiore della Carità Hospital in Novara (Italy). METHODS: To this end, our observational study took into account the imaging studies requested by the emergency department during three-time spans. These were defined as phase 0 (pre-pandemic), phase 1 (pandemic peak with complete lockdown) and phase 2 (post-pandemic peak with partial lifting of restrictive measures), as derived from Italian urgent decrees by the President of the Council of Ministers (DPCM) which established the duration and entity of the lockdown measures throughout the pandemic. The dataset was processed and then compared with Pearson’s chi-squared test. RESULTS: During the pandemic peak, our data showed a significant drop in the total number of studies requested and a significant rise in computed tomography (CT) studies. In particular, a statistically significant increase in chest CT studies was found, probably due to the high sensitivity of this imaging method in identifying pulmonary involvement during respiratory tract infection of possible viral etiology (SARS-Cov-2). Moreover, we observed a statistically significant decrease of X-ray (XR) and ultrasound (US) studies during phase 1 compared to phase 0 and phase 2 probably due to a reduction in the numbers of ER visits for minor traumas given the mobility restrictions and people hesitancy in visiting the ER due to fear of contagion. CONCLUSIONS: We can conclude that the activity of the ERD was heavily impacted by the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic. Further studies will be needed to estimate the impact of the pandemic on public health in terms of excess mortality related to delayed diagnosis and care of non-COVID diseases."
586,10172021053707,"Background: Vaccine hesitancy can limit the benefits of available vaccines in halting the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. Previously published studies paid little attention to Arab countries, which has a population of over 440 million. In this study, we present the results of the first large-scale multinational study that measures vaccine hesitancy among Arab-speaking subjects. Methods: An online survey in Arabic was conducted from 14-Jan-2021 to 29-Jan-2021. It consisted of 17 questions capturing demographic data, acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine, attitudes towards the need for COVID-19 vaccination and associated health policies, and reasons for vaccination hesitancy. R software- v.4.0.2 was used for data analysis and visualization. Results: The survey recruited 36,220 eligible participants (61.1% males, 38.9% females, mean age 32.6±10.8 years) from all the 23 Arab countries and territories (83.4%) and 122 other countries (16.6%). Our analysis shows a significant rate of vaccine hesitancy among Arabs in and outside the Arab region (83% and 81%, respectively). The most cited reasons for hesitancy are concerns about side effects and distrust in healthcare policies, vaccine expedited production, published studies and vaccine producing companies. We also found that female participants, participants 30-59 year-old, those with no chronic diseases, those with lower-level of academic education, and those who do not know the type of vaccine authorized in their countries are more hesitant to receive COVID-19 vaccination. On the other hand, participants who regularly receive the influenza vaccine, health care workers, and those from countries with higher rates of COVID-19 infections showed more vaccination willingness. Interactive representation of our results is posted on our project website at https://mainapp.shinyapps.io/CVHAA. Conclusion: Our results show higher vaccine hesitancy and refusal among Arab subjects, related mainly to distrust and concerns about side effects. Health authorities and Arab scientific community have to transparently address these concerns to improve vaccine acceptance. Funding: This study received no funding."
587,10112020111777,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) appeared in 2019 and is the causative agent of the new pandemic viral disease COVID-19. The outbreak of COVID-19 infection is affecting the entire world, thus many researchers and scientists are desperately looking for suitable vaccines and treatment options. Indeed, researches to find potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 are mainly focused on targeting virus-host interactions or inhibiting viral assembly. Additionally, drugs and other therapeutic agents that modulate broad-spectrum host innate immune responses or interfere with signaling pathways involved in viral replication are important. These drugs may be capable of engaging host receptors or proteases utilized for viral entry or may impact the endocytosis pathway. 3CLpro (3-chymotrypsin-like protease), PLpro (papain-like protease), RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), S protein (viral spike glycoprotein), TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease serine 2), ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), and AT2 (angiotensin AT2 receptor) are important targets. With no approved therapies, this pandemic illustrates the urgent need for safe and broad-spectrum antiviral agents and strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and future pathogenic viruses. In this review, we discussed about the recent trends and important challenges regarding the potential inhibitors, antiviral drugs and nanomaterials screened against SARS-CoV-2."

591,10122020127767,"The fight against COVID-19 is hindered by similarly presenting viral infections that may confound detection and monitoring. We examined person-generated health data (PGHD), consisting of survey and commercial wearable data from individuals' everyday lives, for 230 people who reported a COVID-19 diagnosis between March 30, 2020, and April 27, 2020 (n = 41 with wearable data). Compared with self-reported diagnosed flu cases from the same time frame (n = 426, 85 with wearable data) or pre-pandemic (n = 6,270, 1,265 with wearable data), COVID-19 patients reported a distinct symptom constellation that lasted longer (median of 12 versus 9 and 7 days, respectively) and peaked later after illness onset. Wearable data showed significant changes in daily steps and prevalence of anomalous resting heart rate measurements, of similar magnitudes for both the flu and COVID-19 cohorts. Our findings highlight the need to include flu comparator arms when evaluating PGHD applications aimed to be highly specific for COVID-19."
592,10132021016138,"The intrinsically disordered proteins/regions (IDPs/IDPRs) are known to be responsible for multiple cellular processes and are associated with many chronic diseases. In viruses, the existence of a disordered proteome is also proven and is related to its conformational dynamics inside the host. The SARS-CoV-2 has a large proteome, in which, structure and functions of many proteins are not known yet, along with nsp11. In this study, we have performed extensive experimentation on nsp11. Our results based on the CD spectroscopy gives characteristic disordered spectrum for IDPs. Further, we investigated the conformational behavior of nsp11 in the presence of membrane mimetic environment, α-helix inducer, and natural osmolyte. In the presence of negatively charged and neutral liposomes, nsp11 remains disordered. However, with SDS micelle, it adopted an α-helical conformation, suggesting the helical propensity of nsp11. Finally, we again confirmed the IDP behavior of nsp11 using MD simulations. In future, this conformational dynamic study could help to clarify its functional importance in SARS-CoV-2 infection."
593,10012020010041,"The avian influenza virus outbreak in 1997 highlighted the potential of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus to cause severe disease in humans. Therefore, effective vaccines against H5N1 viruses are needed to counter the potential threat of a global pandemic. We have previously developed a fast-acting and efficacious vaccine against Ebola virus (EBOV) using the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) platform. In this study, we generated recombinant VSV-based H5N1 influenza virus vectors to demonstrate the feasibility of this platform for a fast-acting pan-H5 influenza virus vaccine. We chose multiple approaches regarding antigen design and genome location to define a more optimized vaccine approach. After the VSV-based H5N1 influenza virus constructs were recovered and characterized in vitro, mice were vaccinated by a single dose or prime/boost regimen followed by challenge with a lethal dose of the homologous H5 clade 1 virus. We found that a single dose of VSV vectors expressing full-length hemagglutinin (HAfl) were sufficient to provide 100% protection. The vaccine vectors were fast-acting as demonstrated by uniform protection when administered 3 days prior to lethal challenge. Moreover, single vaccination induced cross-protective H5-specific antibodies and protected mice against lethal challenge with various H5 clade 2 viruses, highlighting the potential of the VSV-based HAfl as a pan-H5 influenza virus emergency vaccine."
594,10092020094271,"BACKGROUND /Objectives: The management of acute pancreatitis (AP) in China has undergone major changes since the launch of the updated guideline in 2013. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of this guideline on clinical practice and patient outcome. METHODS Moderately severe and severe adult AP patients, who were admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2016, were retrospectively included in the study. All enrolled patients were divided into two groups based on the publication date of the updated guideline, as the pre-guideline (Pre) group and post-guideline (Post) group. In-hospital case-fatality rates were compared between two groups after adjusting baseline features, including gender, age, etiology and disease severity. In addition, the associations between specific therapeutic approaches recommended in the updated guideline and in-hospital case-fatality rates were explored. RESULTS A total of 475 patients were enrolled in this study, including 273 (57%) in the Pre group and 202 (43%) in the Post group. The adjusted in-hospital case-fatality rate significantly decreased in the Post group (14.3% vs. 5.9%, OR 0.39, 95%CI 0.19-0.82). In the post-hoc analysis, the use of enteral nutrition was a protective factor against in-hospital death (OR: 0.08, 95%CI: 0.03-0.18), while open surgery showed an opposite effect (OR: 3.81, 95%CI: 1.06-13.74). Prophylactic antibiotics was not significantly associated with in-hospital death (OR: 1.00, 95%CI: 0.39-2.60). CONCLUSIONS There was a prominent transition in the management of moderately severe and severe AP after the release of the guideline in China in 2013, which made the prognosis better."
595,10122020128454,"OBJECTIVE: Evidence-based infection control strategies are needed for healthcare workers (HCWs) following high-risk exposure to severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this study, we evaluated the negative predictive value (NPV) of a home-based 7-day infection control strategy. METHODS: HCWs advised by their infection control or occupational health officer to self-isolate due to a high-risk SARS-CoV-2 exposure were enrolled between May and October 2020. The strategy consisted of symptom-triggered nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing from day 0 to day 7 after exposure and standardized home-based nasopharyngeal swab and saliva testing on day 7. The NPV of this strategy was calculated for (1) clinical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis from day 8–14 after exposure, and for (2) asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 detected by standardized nasopharyngeal swab and saliva specimens collected at days 9, 10, and 14 after exposure. Interim results are reported in the context of a second wave threatening this essential workforce. RESULTS: Among 30 HCWs enrolled, the mean age was 31 years (SD, ±9), and 24 (80%) were female. Moreover, 3 were diagnosed with COVID-19 by day 14 after exposure (secondary attack rate, 10.0%), and all cases were detected using the 7-day infection control strategy: the NPV for subsequent clinical COVID-19 or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 detection by day 14 was 100.0% (95% CI, 93.1%–100.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Among HCWs with high-risk exposure to SARS-CoV-2, a home-based 7-day infection control strategy may have a high NPV for subsequent COVID-19 and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 detection. Ongoing data collection and data sharing are needed to improve the precision of the estimated NPV, and here we report interim results to inform infection control strategies in light of a second wave threatening this essential workforce."
596,10052020059044,"BACKGROUND: Poultry vaccine has limited choices of adjuvants and is facing severe threat of infectious diseases due to ineffective of widely used commercial vaccines. Thus, development of novel adjuvant that offers safe and effective immunity is of urgent need. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present research engineers a novel chicken adjuvant with potent immune-potentiating capability by incorporating avian toll﻿-like receptor 21 (TLR21) agonist CpG ODN 2007 with a poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-based hollow nanoparticle platform (CpG-NP), which subsequently assessed ex vivo and in vivo. RESULTS: CpG-NPs with an average diameter of 164 nm capable of sustained release of CpG for up to 96 hours were successfully prepared. With the ex vivo model of chicken bone marrow﻿-derived dendritic cells (chBMDCs), CpG-NP was engulfed effectively and found to induce DC maturation, promoting dendrite formation and upregulation of CD40, CD80 and CCR7. In addition to enhanced expression of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12 and IFN-γ, 53/84 immune﻿-related genes were found to be stimulated in CpG-NP-treated chBMDCs, whereas only 39 of such genes were stimulated in free CpG-treated cells. These upregulated genes suggest immune skewing toward T helper cell 1 bias and evidence of improved mucosal immunity upon vaccination with the CpG-NP. The CpG-NP-treated chBMDCs showed protective effects to DF-1 cells against avian influenza virus H6N1 infection. Upon subsequent coupling with infectious bronchitis virus subunit antigen administration, chickens were immunostimulated to acquire higher humoral immune response and protective response against viral challenge. CONCLUSTION: This work presents a novel hollow CpG-NP formulation, demonstrating effective and long-lasting immunostimulatory ability ex vivo and in vivo for chickens, as systemically compared to free CpG. This enhanced immune stimulation benefits from high stability and controlled release of internal component of nanoparticles that improve cellular delivery, lymphoid organ targeting and sustainable DC activation. CpG-NP has broad application potential in antiviral and vaccine development."
597,100720200711935,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19) has spread out as a pandemic threat affecting over 2 million people. The infectious process initiates via binding of SARS‐CoV‐2 Spike (S) glycoprotein to host Angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The interaction is mediated by the receptor‐binding domain (RBD) of S glycoprotein, promoting host receptor recognition and binding to ACE2 peptidase domain (PD), thus representing a promising target for therapeutic intervention. Herein, we present a computational study aimed at identifying small molecules potentially able to target RBD. Although targeting PPI remains a challenge in drug discovery, our investigation highlights that interaction between SARS‐CoV‐2 RBD and ACE2 PD might be prone to small molecule modulation, due to the hydrophilic nature of the bi‐molecular recognition process and the presence of druggable hot spots. The fundamental objective is to identify, and provide to the international scientific community, hit molecules potentially suitable to enter the drug discovery process, preclinical validation and development."

599,10152021032696,"Agricultural water management (AWM) interventions play an important role in ensuring sustainable food production and mitigating climate risks. This study was carried out in a watershed located in a low rainfall (400-600 mm) region of western India. The SWAT model was calibrated using surface runoff, soil loss and reservoir storage levels, between the year 2000 and 2006. The investigation indicated that the various AWM interventions increased groundwater recharge from 30 mm/year to 80 mm/year and reduced surface runoff from 250 mm/year to 100 mm/year. The intervention structures were refilled 2 to 3 times during the monsoon season depending on rainfall intensity and duration. The interventions have the advantage of building a resilient system by enhancing groundwater availability even in dry years, stimulating crop intensification and protecting the landscape from severe erosion. The results indicate that soil erosion has been reduced by more than 75% compared to the non-intervention situation. Moreover, the AWM interventions led to the cultivation of 100-150 ha of fallow land with high value crops (horticulture, vegetables and fodder). Household income increased by several-folds compared to the non-intervention situation. The study showed about 50% reduction in downstream water availability, which could be a major concern. However, there are a number of ecosystem trade-offs such as improved base flow to the stream and reduction in soil loss that should be considered. The study is of great importance to stakeholders to decide on the optimum design for AWM interventions to achieve sustainable development goals."
600,101320210111284,"IMPORTANCE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to treatment delays for many patients with cancer. While published guidelines provide suggestions on which cases are appropriate for treatment delay, there are no good quantitative estimates on the association of delays with tumor control or risk of new metastases. OBJECTIVES: To develop a simplified mathematical model of tumor growth, control, and new metastases for cancers with varying doubling times and metastatic potential and to estimate tumor control probability (TCP) and metastases risk as a function of treatment delay interval. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This decision analytical model describes a quantitative model for 3 tumors (ie, head and neck, colorectal, and non–small cell lung cancers). Using accepted ranges of tumor doubling times and metastatic development from the clinical literature from 2001 to 2020, estimates of tumor growth, TCP, and new metastases were analyzed for various treatment delay intervals. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risk estimates for potential decreases in local TCP and increases in new metastases with each interval of treatment delay. RESULTS: For fast-growing head and neck tumors with a 2-month treatment delay, there was an estimated 4.8% (95% CI, 3.4%-6.4%) increase in local tumor control risk and a 0.49% (0.47%-0.51%) increase in new distal metastases risk. A 6-month delay was associated with an estimated 21.3% (13.4-30.4) increase in local tumor control risk and a 6.0% (5.2-6.8) increase in distal metastases risk. For intermediate-growing colorectal tumors, there was a 2.1% (0.7%-3.5%) increase in local tumor control risk and a 2.7% (2.6%-2.8%) increase in distal metastases risk at 2 months and a 7.6% (2.2%-14.2%) increase in local tumor control risk and a 24.7% (21.9%-27.8%) increase in distal metastases risk at 6 months. For slower-growing lung tumors, there was a 1.2% (0.0%-2.8%) increase in local tumor control risk and a 0.19% (0.18%-0.20%) increase in distal metastases risk at 2 months, and a 4.3% (0.0%-10.6%) increase in local tumor control risk and a 1.9% (1.6%-2.2%) increase in distal metastases risk at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study proposed a model to quantify the association of treatment delays with local tumor control and risk of new metastases. The detrimental associations were greatest for tumors with faster rates of proliferation and metastasis. The associations were smaller, but still substantial, for slower-growing tumors."
601,10142021028617,"The type II transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 facilitates the entry of coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, into host cells by cleaving the S(1)/S(2) interface of the viral spike protein. Based on structural data derived from X-ray crystallographic data of related trypsin-like proteases, a homology model of TMPRSS2 is described and validated using the broad spectrum COVID-19 drug candidate camostat as a probe. Both active site recognition and catalytic function are examined using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics molecular dynamic (QM/MM MD) simulations of camostat and its active metabolite, 4-(4-guanidinobenzoyloxy) phenylacetate (GBPA). Substrate binding is shown to be primarily stabilized through salt bridge formation between the shared guanidino pharmacophore and D435 in pocket A (flanking the catalytic S441). Based on the binding mode of GBPA, residues K342 and W461 have been identified as potential contacts involved in TMPRSS2 selective binding and activity. Additional data is reported that indicates the transition state structure is stabilized through H-bonding interactions with the backbone N–H groups within an oxyanion hole following bottom-side attack of the carbonyl by S441. This is supported by prior work on related serine proteases suggesting further strategies to exploit in the design of more potent inhibitors. Taken overall, the proposed structure along with the key contact sites and mechanistic features identified should prove highly advantageous to the design and rational development of safe and effective therapeutics that target TMPRSS2 and avoid inhibition of other trypsin-dependent processes.

602,10132021011657,"OBJECTIVE Identify risk factors that could increase progression to severe disease and mortality in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients in the Southeast US. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter, retrospective cohort including 502 adults hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and May 8, 2020 within one of 15 participating hospitals in 5 health systems across 5 states in the Southeast US. METHODS The study objectives were to identify risk factors that could increase progression to hospital mortality and severe disease (defined as a composite of intensive care unit admission or requirement of mechanical ventilation) in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients in the Southeast US. RESULTS A total of 502 patients were included, and the majority (476/502, 95%) had clinically evaluable outcomes. Hospital mortality was 16% (76/476), while 35% (177/502) required ICU admission, and 18% (91/502) required mechanical ventilation. By both univariate and adjusted multivariate analysis, hospital mortality was independently associated with age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.03 for each decade increase, 95% CI 1.56-2.69), male sex (aOR 2.44, 95% CI: 1.34-4.59), and cardiovascular disease (aOR 2.16, 95% CI: 1.15-4.09). As with mortality, risk of severe disease was independently associated with age (aOR 1.17 for each decade increase, 95% CI: 1.00-1.37), male sex (aOR 2.34, 95% CI 1.54-3.60), and cardiovascular disease (aOR 1.77, 95% CI 1.09-2.85). CONCLUSIONS In an adjusted multivariate analysis, advanced age, male sex, and cardiovascular disease increased risk of severe disease and mortality in patients with COVID-19 in the Southeast US. In-hospital mortality risk doubled with each subsequent decade of life."
603,101620210412669,"BACKGROUND: Adherence to COVID-19 social distancing guidelines varies across individuals. PURPOSE: This study examined the relations of pseudoscientific and just world beliefs, generalized and institutional trust, and political party affiliation to adherence to COVID-19 social distancing guidelines over three months, as well as the explanatory role of COVID-19 risk perceptions in these relations. METHODS: A U.S. nationwide sample of 430 adults (49.8% women; mean age = 40.72) completed a prospective online study, including an initial assessment (between March 27 and April 5, 2020), a 1 month follow-up (between April 27 and May 21, 2020), and a 3 month follow-up (between June 26 and July 15, 2020). We hypothesized that greater pseudoscientific and just world beliefs, lower governmental, institutional, and dispositional trust, and Republican Party affiliation would be associated with lower initial adherence to social distancing and greater reductions in social distancing over time and that COVID-19 risk perceptions would account for significant variance in these relations. RESULTS: Results revealed unique associations of lower governmental trust, greater COVID-19 pseudoscientific beliefs, and greater trust in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to lower initial adherence to social distancing. Whereas greater COVID-19 risk perceptions and CDC trust were associated with less steep declines in social distancing over time, both Republican (vs. Democratic) Party affiliation and greater COVID-19 pseudoscientific beliefs were associated with steeper declines in social distancing over time (relations accounted for by lower COVID-19 risk perceptions). CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight the utility of public health interventions aimed at improving scientific literacy and emphasizing bipartisan support for social distancing guidelines."

The field has expanded remarkably from its initial enzymatic and immunosensor-based setups. This review provides a concise categorization of the ECBs to allow for a better understanding of the development process. The influence of structural aspects of MNPs in biocompatibility and effective sensor design has been explored. The advances in MNP-based ECBs for the detection of some of the most prominent cancer biomarkers (carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen 125 (CA125), Herceptin-2 (HER2), etc.) and small biomolecules (glucose, dopamine, hydrogen peroxide, etc.) have been discussed in detail. Additionally, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) ECBs have been briefly discussed. Beyond that, the limitations and challenges that ECBs face in clinical applications are examined and possible pathways for overcoming these limitations are discussed."
605,10142021027524,"Face masks are an important component in controlling COVID-19, and policy orders to wear masks are common. However, behavioral responses are seldom additive, and exchanging one protective behavior for another could undermine the COVID-19 policy response. We use SafeGraph smart device location data and variation in the date that US states and counties issued face mask mandates as a set of natural experiments to investigate risk compensation behavior. We compare time at home and the number of visits to public locations before and after face mask orders conditional on multiple statistical controls. We find that face mask orders lead to risk compensation behavior. Americans subject to the mask orders spend 11–24 fewer minutes at home on average and increase visits to some commercial locations—most notably restaurants, which are a high-risk location. It is unclear if this would lead to a net increase or decrease in transmission. However, it is clear that mask orders would be an important part of an economic recovery if people otherwise overestimate the risk of visiting public places."

Clearly, not all of these measures are possible in every country due to a lack of resources and healthcare infrastructure, and it will surely be patients who will suffer the most as a result. This issue must be dealt with responsibly on the local level by all countries and patients cooperating with and supporting overwhelmed healthcare systems and aiding the planned implementation of mitigation measures. If not, pockets of SARS-CoV-2 will remain in these regions with continuous suffering of their populations. This is critical as we still do not fully understand the clinical, pathological and epidemiological attributes of SARS-CoV-2; the longer it stays embedded and circulating, the possibility of mutation into a deadlier virus remains along with further waves of epidemics."

COVID-19 is directly linked to China, not just in terms of the origins of the disease, but also in the coverage of it. Because Asian Americans have historically been viewed as perpetually foreign no matter how long they have lived in the United States, we posit that it has been relatively easy for people to treat Chinese or Asian Americans as the physical embodiment of foreignness and disease.

The aim of Arcagen is to generate a multinational database integrating clinical and molecular information of patients with rare cancers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We present the retrospective feasibility cohort of patients with rare cancers, with previously collected tumour samples available from any stage. Molecular analysis was performed using FoundationOne CDx for all histologies except for sarcoma where FoundationOne Heme was used. Clinical data including demographic data, medical history, malignant history, treatment and survival data were collected. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients from three centres were screened; molecular data were obtained for 77 patients (41 sarcomas, 9 yolk sac tumours, 14 rare head and neck cancers, 13 thymomas). The median age at the time of diagnosis was 48 (range 28–85). Most patients had reportable genomic alterations (89%). The most common alterations were linked to cell cycle regulation (TP53, RB1, CDKN2A/B deletions and MDM2 amplification). Multiple activating single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) could be detected in the RAS/RAF family. The tumour mutational burden status was globally low across all samples with a median of 3 Muts/MB (range 0–52). Only 4 cases (ie, 4.7% of tumours) had direct actionable mutations for a treatment approved in Europe within the patient’s tumour type.

613,10132021010549,"The continued circulation of influenza A virus subtype H5 may cause the emergence of new potential pandemic virus variants, which can be transmitted from person to person. The occurrence of such variants is mainly related to mutations in hemagglutinin (HA). Previously we discovered mutations in H5N1 influenza virus hemagglutinin, which contributes to virus immune evasion. The purpose of this work was to study the role of these mutations in changing other, non-antigenic properties of the virus and the possibility of their maintenance in the viral population. Mutations were introduced into the HA gene of a recombinant H5N1 influenza A virus (VNH5N1-PR8/CDC-RG) using site-specific mutagenesis. The “variant” viruses were investigated and compared with respect to replication kinetics in chicken embryos, thermostability, reproductive activity at different temperatures (33, 37 and 40°C), and virulence for mice. Amino acid substitutions I155T, K156Q, K156E+V138A, N186K led to a decrease in thermal stability, replication activity of the mutant viruses in chicken embryos, and virulence for mice, although these effects differed between the variants. The K156Q and N186K mutations reduced viral reproduction at elevated temperature (40°C). The analysis of the frequency of these mutations in natural isolates of H5N1 influenza viruses indicated that the K156E/Q and N186K mutations have little chance to gain a foothold during evolution, in contrast to the I155T mutation, which is the most responsible for antigenic drift. The A138V and N186K mutations seem to be adaptive in mammalian viruses."

Most notable was a doubling in the adoption of telehealth/virtual technology to 28% and increases in the use of remote monitoring and management for improved care (13–22%). These results may now seem insignificant when compared to the unprecedented surge in telehealth visits because of SARS-CoV-2. Even as this surge levels off and begins to decline, many observers believe we will continue to see a persistent increase in the use of virtual visits compared to face-to-face care. The requirements for adoption communicated by physicians in both the 2016 and 2019 surveys are now more relevant than ever: Is remote care as effective as in-person care and how best to determine when to use these modalities? How do I safeguard my patients and my practice from liability and privacy concerns? How do I optimize using these technologies in my practice and, especially integration with my EHR and workflows to improve efficiency? And how will a mix of virtual and in-person visits affect practice revenue and sustainability? Consumers have also expressed concerns about payment for virtual visits as well as privacy and quality of care. If telehealth and remote care are here to stay, continuing to track their impact during the current public health emergency is critically important to address so that policymakers and insurers will take necessary steps to ensure that the “new normal” will reflect a health care delivery model that can provide comparable or improved results today and into the future."
615,10092020092600,"BACKGROUND AND SETTING Little is known about SARS-CoV-2 impact on some vulnerable subgroups, such as people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). In our study we reviewed the current knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 cases in PLWHA. METHODS A systematic review was conducted by searching the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Google Scholar databases. Studies reporting data on PLWHA affected by SARS-CoV-2 were considered for inclusion. The aim of this study was the systematic characterization of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection among PLWHA, particularly focusing on age, clinical findings at diagnosis, radiological features, therapeutic management and clinical outcomes. RESULTS Twenty three relevant articles were identified, which reported 164 adults with both HIV and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of those, the large majority were males (120/142, 84.5%), often with one or more comorbidities. Fifteen cases needed intensive care treatment and 16 died. For each group, respectively three patients had underlying comorbidities. There were no studies on children. The included studies were mostly retrospective or case series/reports (19 studies). The overall risk of bias was moderate, due to the study types and characteristics. CONCLUSION It is still unclear if HIV infection may influence SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease course, however some PLWHA and particularly males affected by ARV-related complications may be at greater risk of severe Covid-19 course."
616,10152021033588,"Telemedicine offers an excellent opportunity to provide continuing health care for those in need during local/global pandemics and disasters. It provides a safe and effective communication tool between health professionals and can be used as ""forward triage"" to manage medical/dental emergencies and to minimize the contact between the patients and clinicians during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Patients with noncommunicable diseases, like cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular, or chronic respiratory diseases, may present with critical health problems due to less access to health care systems during global disasters; opportunities for screening oral mucosa might be significantly disrupted, leading to delayed diagnosis of malignant/potentially malignant lesions. Telemedicine and oral health care associated mobile applications should be implemented to provide equal access to care, to eliminate unnecessary visits to health centers, and to improve practical coordination between professionals and health facilities."
617,10082020088681,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic and international health emergency by the World Health Organization. Patients with obesity with COVID-19 are 7 times more likely to need invasive mechanical ventilation than are patients without obesity (OR 7.36; 95% CI: 1.63–33.14, p = 0.021). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the main causes of death related to COVID-19 and is triggered by a cytokine storm that damages the respiratory epithelium. Interleukins that cause the chronic low-grade inflammatory state of obesity, such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant peptide (MCP)-1, and, in particular, IL-17A and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), also play very important roles in lung damage in ARDS. Therefore, obesity is associated with an immune state favourable to a cytokine storm. Our hypothesis is that serum concentrations of TNF-α and IL-17A are more elevated in patients with obesity and COVID-19, and consequently, they have a greater probability of developing ARDS and death. The immunobiology of IL-17A and TNF-α opens a new fascinating field of research for COVID-19."

622,10122020121316,"While much has been written about adaptable buildings, quantification of adaptability is still in its nascent stage. Little has been published toward validation of quantitative adaptability models. This paper proposes a scoring system for evaluating the design-based adaptability of college campus buildings. This system was created to be a tool to guide future designs. Different physical features (i.e., floor-to-floor height and structural span lengths) of the buildings are considered in the scores. Adaptability scores are calculated for four buildings on Clemson University’s campus. Scores are compared to those from an earlier study of the same buildings; the earlier study quantified adaptability by surveying experts through an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Both approaches rank the subject buildings in the same order with respect to adaptability. Additionally, scores from both approaches are linearly correlated. These encouraging results suggest that the proposed scoring system is a starting point for quantifying the adaptability of college campus buildings."
623,101220201211141,"The coronavirus pandemic led to a severe economic shock in the United States. This paper uses a unique survey data collected early on in the pandemic to measure economic deprivation among individuals. The Federal Reserve Board fielded a Survey of Household Economics and Decision-making (SHED) in April 2020. This survey is used to compile data on four indicators of economic deprivation, namely: i) Overall financial condition, ii) Loss of employment, iii) Reduction in income and iv) Inability to pay bills in full. Data on these indicators is compiled for each individual and is used in a novel way to construct a set of multidimensional deprivation indices. These indices measure the overlap of deprivations experienced by an individual. Results show that almost 25 percent of the respondents faced hardships in at least two of the four indicators. More than 13 percent of adults reported their inability to pay monthly bills and struggled to make ends meet financially. One in four respondents had lower income compared to income from previous month. The economic shock affected Hispanics in a more profound way. More than 37 percent Hispanics reported hardship in two or more indicators and 8 percent reported hardship in all four indicators. Higher proportion of young adults and those without a college degree suffered multiple hardships. The paper highlights the plight of Americans during the early months of the economic crisis set in motion amid the coronavirus pandemic and sheds light on how economic disparities deepened along racial/ethnic lines."
624,10062020066716,"Rumors on social media have always been an important issue that seriously endangers social security. Researches on timely and effective detection of rumors have aroused lots of interest in both academia and industry. At present, most existing methods identify rumors based solely on the linguistic information without considering the temporal dynamics and propagation patterns. In this work, we aim to solve rumor detection task under the framework of representation learning. We first propose a novel way to construct the propagation graph by following the propagation structure (who replies to whom) of posts on Twitter. Then we propose a gated graph neural network based algorithm called PGNN, which can generate powerful representations for each node in the propagation graph. The proposed PGNN algorithm repeatedly updates node representations by exchanging information between the neighbor nodes via relation paths within a limited time steps. On this basis, we propose two models, namely GLO-PGNN (rumor detection model based on the global embedding with propagation graph neural network) and ENS-PGNN (rumor detection model based on the ensemble learning with propagation graph neural network). They respectively adopt different classification strategies for rumor detection task, and further improve the performance by including attention mechanism to dynamically adjust the weight of each node in the propagation graph. Experiments on a real-world Twitter dataset demonstrate that our proposed models achieve much better performance than state-of-the-art methods both on the rumor detection task and early detection task."
625,100920200912002,"Systemic analysis of available large-scale biological and biomedical data is critical for developing novel and effective treatment approaches against both complex and infectious diseases. Owing to the fact that different sections of the biomedical data is produced by different organizations/institutions using various types of technologies, the data are scattered across individual computational resources, without any explicit relations/connections to each other, which greatly hinders the comprehensive multi-omics-based analysis of data. We aimed to address this issue by constructing a new biological and biomedical data resource, CROssBAR, a comprehensive system that integrates large-scale biomedical data from various resources and store them in a new NoSQL database, enrich these data with deep-learning-based prediction of relations between numerous biomedical entities, rigorously analyse the enriched data to obtain biologically meaningful modules and display them to users via easy-to-interpret, interactive and heterogenous knowledge graph (KG) representations within an open access, user-friendly and online web-service at https://crossbar.kansil.org. As a use-case study, we constructed CROssBAR COVID-19 KGs (available at: https://crossbar.kansil.org/covid_main.php) that incorporate relevant virus and host genes/proteins, interactions, pathways, phenotypes and other diseases, as well as known and completely new predicted drugs/compounds. Our COVID-19 graphs can be utilized for a systems-level evaluation of relevant virus-host protein interactions, mechanisms, phenotypic implications and potential interventions."
626,10132021018115,"INTRODUCTION: In May 2020, the World Health Organization recognized olfactory dysfunction as a COVID-19 symptom. The presence of hyposmia/anosmia may be a marker of good prognosis in COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To associate the presence of olfaction disorder to the clinical condition severity in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Individuals with the flu syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2, diagnosed from March to June 2020, were recruited. They were divided into three groups: mild flu syndrome, severe flu syndrome (admitted to hospital wards) and critical illness (admitted to the ICU). Inpatients were interviewed by telephone contact after hospital discharge and their medical records were also evaluated regarding complementary test results. Outpatients answered an electronic questionnaire containing only clinical information. RESULTS: A total of 261 patients participated in the study: 23.75% with mild flu syndrome, 57.85% with severe flu syndrome and 18.40% with critical illness. A total of 66.28% patients with COVID-19 had olfaction disorders. In approximately 56.58% of the individuals the smell alterations lasted between 9 days and 2 months. There was a significantly higher proportion of individuals with olfactory dysfunction in the group with mild flu syndrome than in the severe flu syndrome group (mild × severe – p < 0.001; Odds Ratio = 4.63; 95% CI [1.87–10.86]). This relationship was also maintained between patients with mild flu syndrome and critically-ill patients (mild × critical – p < 0.001; Odds Ratio = 9.28; 95% CI [3.52–25.53]). CONCLUSION: Olfaction dysfunction was significantly more prevalent in patients with mild flu syndrome in COVID-19. It may be a predictor of a good prognosis for this infection. New population-based studies must be carried out to corroborate these findings."

The engineering education system has been improved in recent years through the use of new features, which are provided by e-learning software. Future engineers will require such skills as creative thinking, ability to make informed, effective decisions, as well as social responsibility and eco-thinking. The research was carried out on the tools used to organize online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic in several universities. It gave a possibility to compare the effectiveness of using different virtual environments to organize the training of different profiles’ engineers, as well as to analyze the educational content and its difference from that used in traditional classroom teaching. To make a correct assessment, evaluation criteria were identified, which can be formalized, and also motivational characteristics were classified, which can be influenced on the quality improvement. For a case study, different student’s groups were selected to compare them involvement in the process with traditional and online training forms as well as their performance. Additionally, was done an analysis how a training form impacts on their projects quality."
628,10072020072962,"INTRODUCTION We introduced a nurse-led virtual telephone-based stone follow-up clinic (VSC) for the surveillance of patients with asymptomatic renal calculi or those at a high risk of recurrent kidney stone disease (KSD). The aim of this study was to look at the outcomes of VSC and its role in the post COVID era. METHODS Prospective outcomes were collected for all patients referred to the VSC over a 6-year period (March 2014-April 2020). VSC is led by specialist stone nurses for on-going surveillance of KSD patients. RESULTS A total of 290 patients were seen (468 individual appointments; 1.6±1.0 per patient), with a mean age of 57.0±15.8 years (range:17-92) and a male:female ratio of 3:2. The referral was for surveillance of asymptomatic small renal stones (230,79.3%); history of recurrent stone disease (45,15.5%); solitary kidneys (5,1.7%); cystine stones, young age and other conditions (10,3.4%). The mean stone size was 5.0±2.7 mm, followed-up with XR KUB (225,77.6%) and USS (65,22.4%), for median duration of 12 months (range: 3-24 months). At the end, 132(45.6%) remained in VSC, 106(36.6%) were discharged, 47(16.2%) returned to face-to-face clinic or treatment, and 5(1.7%) had emergency admissions. Of 47 patients that returned, 23(48.9%) developed new symptoms, 21(44.6%) had stone growth, and 3 defaulted to face-to-face appointment. Thirty-five patients needed surgical intervention (URS-21, SWL-12 and PCNL-1) and 10 were managed conservatively. VSC reduced the cost per clinic appointment from £27.9 to £2/patient (93% reduction), equating to a total saving of £12,006 over the study period. CONCLUSION Nurse led VSC not only provided a safe follow-up, but also allowed to substantially reduce the cost of treatment by allowing patients to be either discharged or return to a face-to-face clinic or surgical intervention if needed. Post COVID, this model using telemedicine will have a much wider uptake and further help optimise healthcare resources."
629,10042020044972,"Novel coronaviruses (CoV) have emerged periodically around the world in recent years. The recurrent spreading of CoVs imposes an ongoing threat to global health and the economy. Since no specific therapy for these CoVs is available, any beneficial approach (including nutritional and dietary approach) is worth investigation. Based on recent advances in nutrients and phytonutrients research, a novel combination of vitamin C, curcumin and glycyrrhizic acid (VCG Plus) was developed that has potential against CoV infection. System biology tools were applied to explore the potential of VCG Plus in modulating targets and pathways relevant to immune and inflammation responses. Gene target acquisition, gene ontology and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment were conducted consecutively along with network analysis. The results show that VCG Plus can act on 88 hub targets which are closely connected and associated with immune and inflammatory responses. Specifically, VCG Plus has the potential to regulate innate immune response by acting on NOD-like and Toll-like signaling pathways to promote interferons production, activate and balance T-cells, and regulate the inflammatory response by inhibiting PI3K/AKT, NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. All these biological processes and pathways have been well documented in CoV infections studies. Therefore, our findings suggest that VCG Plus may be helpful in regulating immune response to combat CoV infections and inhibit excessive inflammatory responses to prevent the onset of cytokine storm. However, further in vitro and in vivo experiments are warranted to validate the current findings with system biology tools. Our current approach provides a new strategy in predicting formulation rationale when developing new dietary supplements."
630,10172021051110,"BACKGROUND: Many urgent and elective surgeries were postponed to cope with the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, with latest data found a substantial postoperative mortality risk (25·6%, 18.9%) after emergency and elective surgery, respectively. Our institution was one of the first trust to offer essential elective surgery using a “COVID-free” designated site during the start of the pandemic. The aim of this study is to analyse the clinical outcomes of patients who underwent essential elective procedures during the virus outbreak in the UK. METHOD: Retrospective analysis of outcomes all patients who had undergone urgent elective and cancer surgery, from 30(th) March 2020 to 21(st) May 2020, using an implemented “Super Green Pathway”. The primary endpoints were 30 days mortality and COVID related morbidities, and the secondary endpoints were surgical related complications and oncological outcomes. RESULTS: 92 patients (Male:45%; Female:55%) across 5 surgical specialties were identified. There was no record of mortality in our cohort. Only 1 patient was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 18 days after the initial operation without any pulmonary complications. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to mitigate the high mortality risk of postoperative complications associated with COVID-19, with no delay to essential surgeries for cancer patients, thus delivering safe practice during the pandemic."
631,10122020126479,"The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) states that Norway faces several major health challenges. Sick leave is at 6% and costs employers approximately EUR 1.75 billion annually. The NIPH proposes, with the support of the Public Health Act and the national strategy HealthCare21, that preventive measures should be developed to address negative lifestyle factors in order to decrease the number of new cases in the related disease groups (e.g., stroke, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, obesity). The purpose of this article is to answer why and how organisations should develop a health-promoting performance culture and to provide a conceptual model displaying the importance of this type of culture for organisational performance. To boost the national health standard as a consequence of employee physical activity at work, I suggest additional occupational safety and health (OSH) directives. Based on cross-disciplinary theorizing, I propose a definition of a health-promoting performance culture. This kind of culture consists of dimensions such as health objectives, shared health values, supportive health environment, goal-oriented and value-based behaviour of leaders and employees, and a winning mindset. In addition, the article underscores the importance of related individual HR drivers like fun at work, engagement, physical and mental health for increasing organisational performance. The company cases used in this paper, Schibsted, Gjensidige, Findus and Wilhelmsen, and findings from five in-depth interviews, indicate that health-promoting activities are the result of either an HR strategy or individuals’ initiative and voluntariness among the companies’ sports enthusiasts. The case of Findus exemplifies an ongoing development toward a health-promoting performance culture and the importance of leaders’ participation. The findings support several elements of the conceptual model showing the relations between a health-promoting performance culture, individual HR drivers and organisational performance. A framework for developing a health-promoting performance culture in practice is presented."

METHODS: The RSVs of the selected keywords related to coronavirus and ocular symptoms between 24 January and 1 June 2020 in the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Germany and Turkey were accessed from GT. The numbers of daily COVID-19 new cases and new deaths in the same time interval in the aforementioned countries were compared with the RSVs of the keywords and terms. RESULTS: The United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Germany, and Turkey were the most affected countries from the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. In these countries, statistically significant and strong correlations were found between the daily RSVs of most keywords related to coronavirus and ocular symptoms, and the daily numbers of COVID-19 new cases and new deaths ranging from 0.175 to 0.807. CONCLUSIONS: Ocular symptoms are not the frequent signs of COVID-19, but the ocular surface is a possible route for the transmission of COVID-19. The preliminary outcomes of this study demonstrated that there are significant correlations with the ocular symptoms and COVID-19. The news about the relation of eye and COVID-19 in the mass media may have influenced the Google internet search activity of the public for ocular symptoms."
635,10112020110469,"PURPOSE: Neurologic determination of death (NDD) is legally accepted as death in Canada but remains susceptible to misunderstandings. In some cases, families request continued organ support after NDD. Conflicts can escalate to formal legal challenges, causing emotional, financial, and moral distress for all involved. We describe prevalence, characteristics, and common experiences with requests for continued organ support following NDD in Canada. METHODS: Mixed-methods design combining anonymous online survey with semi-structured interviews of Canadian critical care physicians (448 practitioners, adult and pediatric). RESULTS: One hundred and six physicians responded to the survey and 12 participated in an interview. Fifty-two percent (55/106) of respondents had encountered a request for continued organ support after NDD within two years, 47% (26/55) of which involved threat of legal action. Requests for continued support following NDD ranged from appeals for time for family to gather before ventilator removal to disagreement with the concept of NDD. Common responses to requests included: consultation with an additional physician (54%), consultation with spiritual services (41%), and delay of one to three days for NDD acceptance (49%). Respondents with prior experience were less likely to recommend ancillary tests (P = 0.004) or consultation with bioethics services (P = 0.004). Qualitative analysis revealed perceptions that requests for continued organ support were driven by mistrust, tensions surrounding decision-making, and cultural differences rather than a lack of specific information about NDD. CONCLUSIONS: Family requests for continued somatic support following NDD were encountered by half our sample of Canadian critical care physicians. Mitigation strategies require attention to the multifaceted social contexts surrounding these complex scenarios.

636,10082020086874,"This chapter explores the current and future drivers of change which influence food experiences. The megatrends are seen as major forces that will sharp the future of food experiences. The postmodern consumer finds himself in very conflicting situations within a short timeframe. Here, food becomes an identity-forming element that serves closeness and family-like structures even in situations of singling out. The strengthening of local concepts, authenticity, and current movements such as organic food, the slow food movement, and the concept of value cocreation is identified as important counterparts to singularization, demographic change, urbanization, and globalization within the transformation economy. These concepts also reflect the increasing search for purpose by consumers rather than pure consumption. Based on these developments, this chapter proposes approaches for retailers, gastronomy, and event organizers to develop future concepts of food experiences. As an outlook, food art and food design are considered to support the industry in anticipating the future of food experiences."
637,10132021017226,"Lecture recordings are useful learning resources that can support flexible, remote and distance learning, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. This study explored students’ experiences of engaging with recorded lectures and the extent to which such engagement contributes to enhanced learning. The research involved the deployment of a questionnaire to undergraduate and postgraduate students (n = 660) who had access to lecture recordings at a research intensive public university in New Zealand. Key findings revealed that students who accessed lecture recordings reported an enhanced learning experience. They stated that the availability of lecture recordings created an inclusive learning environment for students with learning disabilities and fostered flexible learning for those who would otherwise be unable to attend lectures either due to sickness or work commitments. Data also suggest that students utilised lecture recordings as supplementary learning resources rather than a substitute for regular lecture attendance. Our findings substantiated previous research studies and additionally demonstrated the various ways in which students engage with lecture recordings. Moreover, the use of sentiment analysis shows how multiple data can be triangulated to confirm or contest research findings. Finally, we believe this study adds to the voice that lecture recordings are vital resources that support students’ learning."
638,10132021018673,"BACKGROUND: The importance of privacy protection in analyses of personal data, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), has grown in recent years. GWAS focuses on identifying single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with certain diseases such as cancer and diabetes, and the chi-squared (χ(2)) hypothesis test of independence can be utilized for this identification. However, recent studies have shown that publishing the results of χ(2) tests of SNPs or personal data could lead to privacy violations. Several studies have proposed anonymization methods for χ(2) testing with ε-differential privacy, which is the cryptographic community’s de facto privacy metric. However, existing methods can only be applied to 2×2 or 2×3 contingency tables, otherwise their accuracy is low for small numbers of samples. It is difficult to collect numerous high-sensitive samples in many cases such as COVID-19 analysis in its early propagation stage. RESULTS: We propose a novel anonymization method (RandChiDist), which anonymizes χ(2) testing for small samples. We prove that RandChiDist satisfies differential privacy. We also experimentally evaluate its analysis using synthetic datasets and real two genomic datasets. RandChiDist achieved the least number of Type II errors among existing and baseline methods that can control the ratio of Type I errors. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a new differentially private method, named RandChiDist, for anonymizing χ(2) values for an I×J contingency table with a small number of samples. The experimental results show that RandChiDist outperforms existing methods for small numbers of samples."
639,10142021021633,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS We assessed the clinical and economic impact of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) in England, Italy, Romania, and Spain. METHODS An HCV progression Markov model was developed considering DAA eligibility and population data during the years 2015-2019. The period of time to recover the investment in DAAs was calculated as the cost saved by avoiding estimated clinical events for 1000 standardized treated patients. A delayed treatment scenario due to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was also developed. RESULTS The estimated number of avoided hepatocellular carcinoma, decompensated cirrhosis, and liver transplantations over a 20-year time horizon was: 1,057 in England; 1,221 in Italy; 1,211 in Romania; and 1,103 in Spain for patients treated during 2015-2016 and 640 in England; 626 in Italy; 739 in Romania; and 643 in Spain for patients treated during 2017-2019. The cost-savings ranged from € 45 to € 275 million. The investment needed to expand access to DAAs in 2015-2019 is estimated to be recovered in 6.5 years in England; 5.4 years in Italy; 6.7 years in Romania; and 4.5 years in Spain. A delay in treatment due to COVID-19 will increase liver mortality in all countries. CONCLUSION DAAs have significant clinical benefits and can bring substantial cost-savings over the next 20 years, reaching a Break-even point in a short period of time. When pursuing an exit strategy from strict lockdown measures for COVID-19, providing DAAs should remain high on the list of priorities in order to maintain HCV elimination efforts."

We found: (i) AM from ozone-exposed mice were in a more oxidized redox state compared to that from filtered air (FA)-exposed mice, consistent with the results obtained from freshly isolated mouse AM; (ii) under FA exposure, there was no significant NAD(H) redox difference between fresh AM that had been placed on ice for 2.5 h and cryopreserved AM; however, under ozone exposure, fresh AM were more oxidized than cryopreserved AM; (iii) via the use of nutrient starvation and replenishment and H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative stress of an AM cell line, we showed that this redox difference between cryopreserved and freshly isolated AM is likely the result of the double “hit”, i.e., the ozone-induced oxidative stress plus nutrient starvation that prevented freshly isolated AM from a full recovery after being on ice for a prolonged time period. The cryopreservation technique we developed eliminates/minimizes the effects of oxidative stress and nutrient starvation on cells. This method can be adopted to preserve lung macrophages from animal models or clinical patients for further investigations."
642,100820200813052,"Background: No epidemiological data exists for the association between mental disorders and the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity. Aims: To evaluate the association between mental disorders and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes following COVID-19. Methods: We performed a cohort study using the Korean COVID-19 patient database based on the national health insurance data. Each patient with a mental or behavioral disorder (diagnosed during six months prior to the first SARS-CoV-2 test) was matched by age, sex, and Charlson comorbidity index with up to four patients without mental disorders. SARS-CoV-2 positivity risk and risk of death or severe events (intensive care unit admission, use of mechanical ventilation, and acute respiratory distress syndrome) post-infection were calculated using conditional logistic regression analysis. Results: Among 230,565 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2, 33,653 (14.6%) had mental disorders, 928/33,653 (2.76%) tested positive, and 56/928 (6.03%) died. In multivariate analysis with the matched cohort, there was no association between mental disorders and SARS-CoV-2 positivity risk (odds ratio [OR], 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92-1.12); however, a higher risk was associated with schizophrenia-related disorders (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.02-1.81). Among confirmed cases, mortality risk significantly increased in patients with mental disorders (OR, 1.84, 95% CI, 1.07-3.15). Conclusion: Mental disorders are likely contributing factors of mortality following COVID-19. Although the infection risk did not increase in overall mental disorders, patients with schizophrenia-related disorders were more vulnerable to the infection."

644,10092020095609,"Can an agent learn efficiently in a noisy and self adapting environment with sequential, non-stationary and non-homogeneous observations? Through trading bots, we illustrate how Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can tackle this challenge. Our contributions are threefold: (i) the use of contextual information also referred to as augmented state in DRL, (ii) the impact of a one period lag between observations and actions that is more realistic for an asset management environment, (iii) the implementation of a new repetitive train test method called walk forward analysis, similar in spirit to cross validation for time series. Although our experiment is on trading bots, it can easily be translated to other bot environments that operate in sequential environment with regime changes and noisy data. Our experiment for an augmented asset manager interested in finding the best portfolio for hedging strategies shows that AAMDRL achieves superior returns and lower risk."
645,10132021017540,"INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Pneumopericardium is collection of gas in pericardial space. Retrospective reviews have described pneumopericardium as a complication of laparoscopic surgery, however, without any symptoms. By this report, we present a case who developed acute cardiopulmonary symptoms after retroperitoneal laparoscopic radical nephrectomy because of pneumopericardium. CASE PRESENTATION: A 40-year-old Vietnamese woman was admitted due to left flank pain. She was diagnosed with left dysfunctional hydronephrosis and right urolithiasis. Six hours post-operation of an elective retroperitoneal laparoscopic radical nephrectomy, she suddenly developed severe substernal chest pain and dyspnea. Evaluations for acute myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism were immediately ordered with no abnormality. However, computed tomography scan of the chest showed pneumopericardium, pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, gas collection in sub-peritoneal space and next to the aortic arch. She was then closely monitored and effectively managed by conservative treatments. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Pneumopericardium is a rare complication of laparoscopy and mainly detected by radiographical measures incidentally. Several case studies reported symptomatic pneumopericardium, as in our presenting case. Some factors might contribute to the mechanism of our case that include retroperitoneal approach, thoroughly dissection the renal helium area and long-lasting operation. Post-operative collection of carbon dioxide is well self-limited; therefore, conservative treatments are efficient for stable cases. CONCLUSION: Pneumopericardium following laparoscopy is uncommon, and mostly subclinical. However, it can manifest as acute cardiopulmonary symptoms and signs that require carefully evaluation. The presence of gas in pericardial space is a negative prognosis factor itself; consequently, clinicians should be aware of when managing pneumopericardium subsequent to laparoscopic procedures."

Nursing students have been greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in documented trauma, complicated grief, depression, anxiety, and secondary stress syndrome. Students entering health care in a new landscape of ongoing trauma and chronic stress exposure require a shift in the nurse educators' role and position. Extensive outcome-based synthesis of trauma-informed education in other disciplines served as basis to create a pedagogical context using the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) framework for trauma-informed schools. Utilizing Watson's strategies for human caring theory in nursing education, a trauma-informed pedagogy is proposed for nurse educators. This framework for nurse educators and leaders will assist in navigating how to approach trauma-informed education in the context of higher education in nursing. It is time for a paradigm shift in nursing education towards a more collaborative, relational model with students, based on trauma-informed care; where trauma awareness and the impact on one's being serves purpose for the nursing student."
647,10022020020346,"BACKGROUND Influenza A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09 and B viruses co-circulated in Europe in 2017-18, predominated by influenza B. WHO-recommended, trivalent vaccine components were lineage-mismatched for B. The I-MOVE hospital network measured 2017-18 seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) against influenza A(H3N2) and B among hospitalised patients (≥65 years) in Europe. METHODS Following the same generic protocol for test-negative design, hospital teams in nine countries swabbed patients ≥65 years with recent onset (≤7 days) severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), collecting information on demographics, vaccination status and underlying conditions. Cases were RT-PCR positive for influenza A(H3N2) or B; controls: negative for any influenza. ""Vaccinated"" patients had SARI onset >14 days after vaccination. We measured pooled IVE against influenza, adjusted for study site, age, sex, onset date and chronic conditions. RESULTS We included 3483 patients: 376 influenza A(H3N2) and 928 B cases, and 2028 controls. Most (>99%) vaccinated patients received the B lineage-mismatched trivalent vaccine. IVE against influenza A(H3N2) was 24% (95% CI: 2 to 40); 35% (95% CI: 6 to 55) in 65- to 79-year-olds and 14% (95% CI: -22 to 39) in ≥80-year-olds. Against influenza B, IVE was 30% (95% CI: 16 to 41); 37% (95% CI: 19 to 51) in 65- to 79-year-olds and 19% (95% CI: -7 to 38) in ≥80-year-olds. CONCLUSIONS IVE against influenza B was similar to A(H3N2) in hospitalised older adults, despite trivalent vaccine and circulating B lineage mismatch, suggesting some cross-protection. IVE was lower in those ≥80 than 65-79 years. We reinforce the importance of influenza vaccination in older adults as, even with a poorly matched vaccine, it still protects one in three to four of this population from severe influenza."
648,10092020092166,"PURPOSE Insomnia affects up to one in four adolescents and has been shown to have a negative impact on their mental and physical health. This study aimed to investigate the association between insomnia, academic performance, self-reported health, physical activity, school start time, and substance use among adolescents. METHODS A survey with a cross-sectional design was completed by adolescents (15-17 years old; n = 1504) in southern Sweden. The Minimal Insomnia Symptoms Scale (MISS) was used to operationalize insomnia. A multiple logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the relationship between insomnia and self-reported health, failed school courses, substance use, school start time, family financial situation, screen time, and gender. RESULTS Insomnia (MISS ≥ 6) was associated with poor self-reported health (OR: 4.35), failed school courses (OR: 1.47), and use of alcohol and/or cigarettes (OR: 1.43). When the combined effect of self-reported health and physical activity were investigated, a combination of low physical activity (≤1 time/week) and poor self-reported health was strongly associated with insomnia (OR: 18.87). CONCLUSIONS Insomnia was associated with other problems that in themselves are risk factors for poor health. This highlights the need for a holistic health-promoting approach to prevent insomnia, such as efforts to promote physical activity, school success, and the reduction of alcohol/cigarette use."
649,10062020069343,"The COVID 19 pandemic caused by the novel corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) has been one of the major public health concerns across the globe, currently more than 3.5 million individuals have been infected, and the number of deaths has passed 250,000. The world wide burden of the disease has been massive, and the governments are in dilemma to protect the health system of the country while safeguarding the economy. There is no vaccine or antivirus drug found against this virus while multiple research groups are actively working on a suitable candidate. The only available mode of minimizing the disease burden has been to control its transmission among the population. Since the occurrence of first COVID 19 local case on 11 March 2020, the government of Sri Lanka introduced serious social distancing and public health interventions in its fullest capacity as a developing nation to effectively combat with the disease spread. This study focuses to develop a mathematical model to investigate the dynamic of this novel disease using an extended version of an SEIR compartmental structure considering the heterogeneity of cases such as asymptomatic, symptomatic with mild indications and the cases required intensive care treatments. All the measures and interventions are in progress with a significantly large social and economic cost, thus, optimal control techniques are used to identify the most appropriate strategies to minimize this cost. The results of the simulations prove that optimal control measures can be worked out as the epidemic curves are flattened while delaying the outbreak so that the health system might not be under pressure to treat and care the patients."
650,10112020118753,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer care services and overall (direct and indirect) excess deaths in people with cancer. METHODS: We employed near real-time weekly data on cancer care to determine the adverse effect of the pandemic on cancer services. We also used these data, together with national death registrations until June 2020 to model deaths, in excess of background (pre-COVID-19) mortality, in people with cancer. Background mortality risks for 24 cancers with and without COVID-19-relevant comorbidities were obtained from population-based primary care cohort (Clinical Practice Research Datalink) on 3 862 012 adults in England. RESULTS: Declines in urgent referrals (median=−70.4%) and chemotherapy attendances (median=−41.5%) to a nadir (lowest point) in the pandemic were observed. By 31 May, these declines have only partially recovered; urgent referrals (median=−44.5%) and chemotherapy attendances (median=−31.2%). There were short-term excess death registrations for cancer (without COVID-19), with peak relative risk (RR) of 1.17 at week ending on 3 April. The peak RR for all-cause deaths was 2.1 from week ending on 17 April. Based on these findings and recent literature, we modelled 40% and 80% of cancer patients being affected by the pandemic in the long-term. At 40% affected, we estimated 1-year total (direct and indirect) excess deaths in people with cancer as between 7165 and 17 910, using RRs of 1.2 and 1.5, respectively, where 78% of excess deaths occured in patients with ≥1 comorbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Dramatic reductions were detected in the demand for, and supply of, cancer services which have not fully recovered with lockdown easing. These may contribute, over a 1-year time horizon, to substantial excess mortality among people with cancer and multimorbidity. It is urgent to understand how the recovery of general practitioner, oncology and other hospital services might best mitigate these long-term excess mortality risks."

652,10112020117460,"A SARS-CoV2 super-spreading event occurred during carnival in a small town in Germany. Due to the rapidly imposed lockdown and its relatively closed community, this town was seen as an ideal model to investigate the infection fatality rate (IFR). Here, a 7-day seroepidemiological observational study was performed to collect information and biomaterials from a random, household-based study population. The number of infections was determined by IgG analyses and PCR testing. We found that of the 919 individuals with evaluable infection status, 15.5% (95% CI:[12.3%; 19.0%]) were infected. This is a fivefold higher rate than the reported cases for this community (3.1%). 22.2% of all infected individuals were asymptomatic. The estimated IFR was 0.36% (95% CI:[0.29%; 0.45%]) for the community and 0.35% [0.28%; 0.45%] when age-standardized to the population of the community. Participation in carnival increased both infection rate (21.3% versus 9.5%, p < 0.001) and number of symptoms (estimated relative mean increase 1.6, p = 0.007). While the infection rate here is not representative for Germany, the IFR is useful to estimate the consequences of the pandemic in places with similar healthcare systems and population characteristics. Whether the super-spreading event not only increases the infection rate but also affects the IFR requires further investigation."
653,10052020050060,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To briefly review epidemiology and pathophysiology of SICM and provide a more extensive review of the data on diagnostic and management strategies. RECENT FINDINGS: SICM is likely underdiagnosed and that has mortality implications. Current evidence supports speckle tracking echocardiography to identify decreased contractility irrespective of left ventricular ejection fraction for the diagnosis of SICM. There continues to be a dearth of large clinical trials evaluating the treatment of SICM and current consensus focuses on supportive measures such as vasopressors and inotropes. SUMMARY: Sepsis is a significant cause of mortality, and sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy has both prognostic and management implications for these patients. Individualized work-up and management of these patients is crucial to improving outcomes."
654,10062020066070,"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel pandemic coronavirus that caused a global health and economic crisis. The development of efficient drugs and vaccines against COVID-19 requires detailed knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 biology. Several techniques to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection have been established, mainly based on counting infected cells by staining plaques or foci, or by quantifying the viral genome by PCR. These methods are laborious, time-consuming and expensive and therefore not suitable for a high sample throughput or rapid diagnostics. We here report a novel enzyme-based immunodetection assay that directly quantifies the amount of de novo synthesized viral spike protein within fixed and permeabilized cells. This in-cell ELISA enables a rapid and quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in microtiter format, regardless of the virus isolate or target cell culture. It follows the established method of performing ELISA assays and does not require expensive instrumentation. Utilization of the in-cell ELISA allows to e.g. determine TCID50 of virus stocks, antiviral efficiencies (IC50 values) of drugs or neutralizing activity of sera. Thus, the in-cell spike ELISA represents a promising alternative to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and inhibition and may facilitate future research. Highlights Determination of SARS-CoV-2 infection by enzymatically quantifying the expression of viral spike protein in bulk cell cultures Targeting a highly conserved region in the S2 subunit of the S protein allows broad detection of several SARS-CoV-2 isolates in different cell lines Screening of antivirals in microtiter format and determining the antiviral activity as inhibitory concentrations 50 (IC50)"

656,10152021035847,"Colexification refers to the phenomenon of multiple meanings sharing one word in a language. Cross-linguistic lexification patterns have been shown to be largely predictable, as similar concepts are often colexified. We test a recent claim that, beyond this general tendency, communicative needs play an important role in shaping colexification patterns. We approach this question by means of a series of human experiments, using an artificial language communication game paradigm. Our results across four experiments match the previous cross-linguistic findings: all other things being equal, speakers do prefer to colexify similar concepts. However, we also find evidence supporting the communicative need hypothesis: when faced with a frequent need to distinguish similar pairs of meanings, speakers adjust their colexification preferences to maintain communicative efficiency, and avoid colexifying those similar meanings which need to be distinguished in communication. This research provides further evidence to support the argument that languages are shaped by the needs and preferences of their speakers."
657,10172021056119,"PURPOSE: The PhenX Toolkit (www.phenxtoolkit.org), an online catalog of recommended measurement protocols, facilitates cross-study analyses for research with human participants. The PhenX Steering Committee recommended genomic medicine implementation as a new research domain, with the following scope: genomic knowledge and education (both patients and providers); implementation science; changes in management and treatment; return of results; patient outcomes; and ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI) associated with genomic research. METHODS: A seven-member expert Working Group convened in October 2019 to identify well-established measurement protocols for a new genomic medicine implementation domain and used the established PhenX consensus process to select measurement protocols for inclusion in the PhenX Toolkit. RESULTS: The Working Group recommended 15 measurement protocols for inclusion in the PhenX Toolkit, with priority given to those with empirical evidence supporting validity. Consortia funded by the National Institutes of Health, and particularly the National Human Genome Research Institute, proved critical in identifying protocols with established utility in this research domain, and identified protocols that were developed through a rigorous process for scope elements that lacked formally validated protocols. CONCLUSION: Use of these protocols, which were released in September 2020, can facilitate standard data collection for genomic medicine implementation research."
658,10122020121470,"OBJECTIVE Open surgical tracheotomy performed beside (STB) is a standardized procedure in critical ill patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate perioperative complications and the safety of STB in a tertiary care university hospital setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS Intra- and postoperative complications were retrospectively recorded and associations based on the evaluation of clinical and laboratory parameters were studied using regression analyses. RESULTS A total of 562 patients were included. Early tracheotomy shortened ventilation time after tracheotomy (ventilation before STB ≤ 5 days: mean 9.2 ± 9.1 days; ventilation before STB ≥ 6 days: mean 11.5 ± 10.5 days, p = 0.0001). Overall complications were found in 30/562 cases (5.3%), major complications in 12/562 cases (2.1%). Significant risk factors for overall tracheotomy related complications were higher body mass index (odds ratio [OR] 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.07, p = 0.02), lower CRP (OR 0.99, CI 0.99-1.00, p = 0.03), higher INR (OR 5.67, CI 1.27-25.34, p = 0.02), longer duration of operation (OR 1.03, CI 1.00-1.06, p = 0.04) and tracheotomy during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support (OR 6.26, CI 1.21-32.44, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION STB represents a safe surgical procedure, also suitable for patients with an increased risk profile. Careful evaluation of individual risk factors should be favored to reduce procedure related complications."
659,10162021045802,"BACKGROUND: Ocrelizumab safety outcomes have been well evaluated in clinical trials and open-label extension (OLE) studies. However, risk factors for infection in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) receiving ocrelizumab have not been extensively studied in the real-world setting. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine factors determining risk of self-reported infections and antimicrobial use in patients receiving ocrelizumab for MS. METHODS: A retrospective, observational cohort study was conducted in patients receiving ocrelizumab at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. Infection type and number were reported by patients, and the associations of potential clinical and laboratory risk factors with self-reported infection and antimicrobial use were estimated using univariate and multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: A total of 185 patients were included in the study; a total of 176 infections were reported in 89 patients (46.1%), and antimicrobial use was identified in 47 patients (25.3%). In univariate analyses, a higher serum IgA was associated with reduced odds of infection (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.25–0.76). In multivariable analyses, older age (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.88–0.99), higher serum IgA (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.17–0.80) and higher serum IgG (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67–0.99) were associated with reduced odds of infection. Older age (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75–0.96) and higher serum IgA (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.07–0.79) were associated with reduced odds of antimicrobial use, whilst longer MS disease duration (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.06–1.41) and higher Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.02–3.86) were associated with increased odds of antimicrobial use. CONCLUSIONS: Higher serum IgA and IgG and older age were associated with reduced odds of infection. Our findings highlight that infection risk is not uniform in patients with MS receiving ocrelizumab and substantiate the need to monitor immunoglobulin levels pre-treatment and whilst on therapy.

660,10032020032943,"COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is the most recent pandemic disease the world is currently managing. It started in China at the end of 2019, and it is diffusing throughout Italy, one of the most affected countries, and it is currently spreading through European countries and USA. Patients affected by COVID-19 are identified employing medical swabs applied mainly to (i) citizens with COVID-19 symptoms such as flu or high temperature, or (ii) citizens that had contacts with COVID-19 patients. A percentage of COVID-19 affected patients needs hospitalisation, whereas a portion needs to be treated in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Nevertheless, it is a matter of current intuition that COVID-19 infected citizens are more than those detected, and sometime the infection is detected too late. Thus there are many efforts in both tracking people activities as well as diffusing low cost reliable COVID-19 tests for early detection. Starting from mortality rates of diseases caused by viruses in the same family (e.g. MERS, SARS, H1N1), we study the relations between the number of COVID-19 infections and the number of deaths, through Italian regions. We thus assess several infections being higher than the ones currently measured. We thus focus on the characterisation of the pandemic diffusion by estimating the infected number of patients versus the number of death. We use such an estimated number of infections, to foresee the effects of restriction actions adopted by governments to constrain virus diffusion. We finally think that our model can support the healthcare system to react when COVID-19 is increasing."
661,10172021058134,"Background Convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) is one of the well-known therapeutic protocols for treating infectious diseases that do not have special treatment nor vaccine. Several documents confirm the clinical efficacy of this therapy for treating bacterial and viral infections. Methods A comprehensive systematic search was conducted by August 2020 using global databases including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane library, Google scholar, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist was used to evaluate the included studies. Using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software version 2.2 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA), the pooled data analysis process was performed. Results A total of 15 eligible articles were enrolled in the current quantitative synthesis. The statistical analysis showed that clinical improvement in the group of patients who had received convalescent plasma was significantly increased compared to the control group (OR: 2.23; 1.12-4.45 with 95% CIs; p value: 0.022; Q-value: 6.11; I 2 : 83.64; Eggers p value: 0.064; Beggs p value: 0.093). Furthermore, the rate of hospital discharge had increased in patients receiving CPT (OR: 2.92; 1.48-5.77 with 95% CIs; p value: 0.002; Q-Value: 4.32; I 2 : 53.80; Eggers p value: 0.32; Beggs p value: 0.50). Conclusions Because there is currently no fully effective antiviral drug against the virus, and it will take time to confirm the effectiveness of new drugs, CPT can be used as an alternative treatment strategy to improve the severe clinical manifestations of COVID-19."
662,10092020093278,"Casual videogames (CVGs), played on smartphones, are becoming increasingly popular, especially among females and adults. Whereas the addictive potential of online (computer) videogames is well-established, there is yet insufficient evidence for Internet gaming disorder (IGD) in mobile gamers and for the mediating role of some mechanisms involved. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of the frustration of psychological needs on mobile videogamers' addictive behavior as well as the role of cognitions (game-use expectancies) and behaviors (time spent playing) through a hypothesized serial mediation model, while controlling for important correlates, such as game genre, age, gender and payment during play. A total of 471 mobile game users (211 males) with an average age of 21.73 replied to an online survey containing sociodemographic and game variables, the Need Satisfaction and Frustration Scale (NSFS), the Internet Gaming Disorder Scale-Short Form (IGDS9-SF) and a slightly modified version of the Internet Use Expectancies Scale (IUES). The results corroborate the negative effects of need frustration on IGD among mobile gamers and clarify the role of time spent playing and game-use expectancies in the development of IGD, highlighting the important role of cognitions in this relationship. We conclude that both the time spent playing and game-use expectancies should be important targets for clinical interventions, even though they are not included in the diagnostic criteria."

Methods: We performed a retrospective study on the clinical characteristics of 128 COVID-19 cases with laboratory-confirmed from Xiangyang No 1 Hospitalad during January 2020 to 16 February 2020. Results: Female patients account for 53.1%. The aged below 20 years that accounts for 1.6% of overall patients. The aged in 21~50, 51~65, over 66 years were accounts for 44.5%, 35.1%,18.8%, respectively. In the difference age spectrum, all severe groups compared with non-severe groups were difference significantly ( P < 0.01 ). Fever ( 89.8% ) and Cough ( 67.2% ) were common clinical symptoms. The rate of patients with sore throats (14.1%) was rare. The rate of chest computed tomography scan showing ground glass opacity in overall, non-severe, severe groups were 63.3%, 60.7%, 76.2%, respectively. White blood cell counts in the normal range of overall patients, but severe group patients were increased significantly ( P < 0.01). Lymphocytes of overall patients were decreased. Alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) in the normal range of overall patients, but its were elevated in the severe group. Creatinine (CR) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of overall patients in the normal range. C-reactive protein (CRP) level of all patients were increased markedly, but it in the severe group was significantly higher than that in the non-severe group ( P < 0.01 ). Conclusions: Our data provide more information that advanced age, lower lymphocytes levels at the diagnosed COVID-19 patients may be a risk factor for unfavourable prognosis. The white blood cells and C-reactive protein level elevated in severe COVID-19 patients may be accompanying bacterial infection. 2019-nCov may be carries a risk factor of impaired liver and kidney function."

By not relieving buyers from their purchase obligations, even after respective market meltdowns and the disappearance of demand, force majeure, as defined in most energy contracts, can incentivise irrational energy use and waste, and is thus incompatible with a low-carbon transition. Climate regulation preventing a party from using fossil fuels can excuse performance of the obligation to purchase fossil energy, but the affected party can be required to challenge these decarbonisation measures and thus oppose the low-carbon transition. To avoid these perverse effects and align energy contracts to the reality of decarbonisation, economic hardship and environmental regulation should be explicitly included in force majeure clauses."
666,10142021027242,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the Lumipulse® SARS-CoV-2 antigen test with the gold standard real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to evaluate its role in screening programs. METHODS: Lumipulse® SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay was compared to the gold standard RT-PCR test, in a selected cohort of 226 subjects with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and its accuracy was evaluated. Subsequently, the test was administered to a real-life screening cohort of 1,738 cases. ROC analysis was performed to explore test features and cutoffs. All tests were performed in the regional reference laboratory in Umbria, Italy. RESULTS: In the selected cohort we observed 42.0% positive results at RT-PCR. The Lumipulse® system showed 92.6% sensitivity (95% CI 85.4-97.0%) and 90.8% specificity (95% CI 84.5-95.2%) at 1.24 pg/mL optimal cutoff. In the screening cohort, characterized by 5.2% prevalence of infection, Lumipulse® assay showed 100% sensitivity (95% CI 96.0-100.0%) and 94.8% specificity (95% CI 93.6-95.8%) at 1.645 pg/mL optimal cutoff. The AUC was 97.4%, NPV was 100% (95% CI 99.8-100.0%) and PPV 51.1% (95% CI 43.5-58.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Lumipulse® SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay can be safely employed in the screening strategies in small and large communities and in the general population."
667,100620200610965,"The province of Bergamo in Italy and in particular Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital was one of the first areas to be hit by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and experience firsthand all the different phases of the crisis. We describe the timeline of the changes in overall urological workload during the outbreak period from lockdown to the slow reopening of activities. We sought to compare the 2020 hospital scenario with normality in the same period in 2019, highlighting the rationale behind decision-making when guidelines were not yet available. While we focus on the changes in surgical volumes for both elective (oncological and noncancer) and urgent cases, we have still to confront the risk of untreated and underdiagnosed patients. PATIENT SUMMARY: We present a snapshot of changes in urology during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in our hospital in Bergamo, Italy. The effect of medical lockdown on outcomes for untreated or underdiagnosed patients is still unknown."
668,100920200914315,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate factors associated with adherence to self-isolation and lockdown measures due to COVID-19 in the UK. STUDY DESIGN: Online cross-sectional survey. METHODS: Data were collected between 6th and 7th May 2020. A total of 2240 participants living in the UK aged 18 years or older were recruited from YouGov's online research panel. RESULTS: A total of 217 people (9.7%) reported that they or someone in their household had symptoms of COVID-19 (cough or high temperature/fever) in the last 7 days. Of these people, 75.1% had left the home in the last 24 h (defined as non-adherent). Men were more likely to be non-adherent, as were people who were less worried about COVID-19, and who perceived a smaller risk of catching COVID-19. Adherence was associated with having received help from someone outside your household. Results should be taken with caution as there was no evidence for associations when controlling for multiple analyses. Of people reporting no symptoms in the household, 24.5% had gone out shopping for non-essentials in the last week (defined as non-adherent). Factors associated with non-adherence and with a higher total number of outings in the last week included decreased perceived effectiveness of government ‘lockdown’ measures, decreased perceived severity of COVID-19 and decreased estimates of how many other people were following lockdown rules. Having received help was associated with better adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to self-isolation is poor. As we move into a new phase of contact tracing and self-isolation, it is essential that adherence is improved. Communications should aim to increase knowledge about actions to take when symptomatic or if you have been in contact with a possible COVID-19 case. They should also emphasise the risk of catching and spreading COVID-19 when out and about and the effectiveness of preventative measures. Using volunteer networks effectively to support people in isolation may promote adherence."

As listed in recent literature, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, olfactory and gustatory systems are commonly involved. With the growing knowledge about the disease, varied manifestations have been identified and lately, otorhinolaryngology dysfunctions in COVID 19 have been described. Hearing loss in COVID era is one of the emerging areas of concern and calls for further research in the field for the better understanding and treatment of this entity. This study was designed to assess the audiological profile among 100 mild to moderately affected COVID-19 individuals, so as to make a contribution to the emerging literature on otologic manifestations in COVID 19. In our case series, high frequency hearing loss and referred OAE was noted among significant number of COVID 19 positive patients. This was even observed in patients without any otologic symptoms. Hence, early identification and intervention if required helps to give a better quality of life to the patient."
670,101220201210539,"There are currently few approved effective treatments for SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Nanobodies are 12–15 kDa single-domain antibody fragments that can be delivered by inhalation and are amenable to relatively inexpensive large scale production compared to other biologicals. We have isolated nanobodies that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain and block spike protein interaction with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with 1–5 nM affinity. The lead nanobody candidate, NIH-CoVnb-112, blocks SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus infection of HEK293 cells expressing human ACE2 with an EC(50) of 0.3 µg/mL. NIH-CoVnb-112 retains structural integrity and potency after nebulization. Furthermore, NIH-CoVnb-112 blocks interaction between ACE2 and several high affinity variant forms of the spike protein. These nanobodies and their derivatives have therapeutic, preventative, and diagnostic potential."

In order to expedite integrated and collaborative COVID-19 research, we completed multi-omics analysis of hospitalized COVID-19 patients including matched analysis of the whole blood transcriptome, plasma proteomics with two complementary platforms, cytokine profiling, plasma and red blood cell metabolomics, deep immune cell phenotyping by mass cytometry, and clinical data annotation. We refer to this multidimensional dataset as the COVIDome. We then created the COVIDome Explorer, an online researcher portal where the data can be analyzed and visualized in real time. We illustrate here the use of the COVIDome dataset through a multi-omics analysis of biosignatures associated with C-reactive protein (CRP), an established marker of poor prognosis in COVID-19, revealing associations between CRP levels and damage-associated molecular patterns, depletion of protective serpins, and mitochondrial metabolism dysregulation. We expect that the COVIDome Explorer will rapidly accelerate data sharing, hypothesis testing, and discoveries worldwide."
672,10052020056411,"OBJECTIVE: Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that colchicine may have metabolic and cardiovascular and benefits in at-risk patients; however, the mechanisms through which colchicine may improve outcomes are still unclear. We sought to examine colchicine’s effects on circulating inflammatory and metabolic molecules in adults with obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS). METHODS: Blood samples were collected pre- and post-intervention during a double-blind randomized controlled trial in which 40 adults with obesity and MetS were randomized to colchicine 0.6 mg or placebo twice-daily for 3 months. Serum samples were analyzed for 1305 circulating factors using the SomaScan Platform. The Benjamini–Hochberg procedure was used to adjust the false discovery rate (FDR) for multiple testing. RESULTS: At baseline, age (48.0 ± 13.8 vs. 44.7 ± 10.3 years) and BMI (39.8 ± 6.4 vs. 41.8 ± 8.2 kg/m(2)) were not different between groups. After controlling for the FDR, 34 molecules were significantly changed by colchicine. Colchicine decreased concentrations of multiple inflammatory molecules, including C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, and resistin, in addition to vascular-related proteins (e.g., oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor, phosphodiesterase 5A). Conversely, relative to placebo, colchicine significantly increased concentrations of eight molecules including secreted factors associated with metabolism and anti-thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: In adults with obesity, colchicine significantly affected concentrations of proteins involved in the innate immune system, endothelial function and atherosclerosis, uncovering new mechanisms behind its cardiometabolic effects. Further research is warranted to investigate whether colchicine’s IL-6 suppressive effects may be beneficial in COVID-19."

674,101320210110824,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019. On February 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the name for the new illness caused by SARS-CoV-2: COVID-19. By March 11, the outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the WHO. This virus has extensively altered daily life for many across the globe, while claiming hundreds of thousands of lives. While fundamentally a respiratory illness, many infected individuals experience symptoms that involve the central nervous system (CNS). It is likely that many of these symptoms are the result of the virus residing outside of the CNS. However, the current evidence does indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can use olfactory neurons to travel from the periphery into the CNS, and that the virus may also enter the brain through the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We discuss how the virus may use established infection mechanisms (ACE2, TMPRSS2, and Cathepsin L), as well mechanisms still under consideration (NRP1 and BASIGIN) to infect and spread throughout the CNS. Confirming the impact of the virus on the CNS will be crucial in dealing with the long-term consequences of the epidemic."
675,10172021050568,"In the era of autonomous robots, multi-targets search methods inspired researchers to develop adapted algorithms to robot constraints, and with the rising of Swarm Intelligence approaches, Swarm Robotics became a very popular topic. In this paper, the problem of searching for an exponentially increasing number of targets in a complex and unknown environment is addressed. Our main objective is to propose a Robotic target search strategy based on the Elephants Herding Optimization (EHO) algorithm, namely Robotic-EHO (REHO). The main additions were the collision-free path planning strategy, the velocity limitation, and the extension to the multi-target version in discrete environments. The proposed method has been the subject of many experiments, emulating the search of infected individuals by COVID-19 in a context of containment within complex and unknown random environments, as well as in the real case study of the USA. The particularity of these environments is their increasing targets’ number and the dynamic Containment Rate (CR) that we propose. The experimental results show that REHO reacts much better in high CR, early start search mission, and where the robots’ speed is higher than the virus spread speed."
676,10122020127001,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is one of the biggest pandemics in human history, along with other disease pandemics, such as the H1N1 influenza A, bubonic plague, and smallpox pandemics. This study is a small contribution that tries to find contrasted formulas to alleviate global suffering and guarantee a more manageable future. OBJECTIVE: In this study, a statistical approach was proposed to study the correlation between the incidence of COVID-19 in Spain and search data provided by Google Trends. METHODS: We assessed the linear correlation between Google Trends search data and the data provided by the National Center of Epidemiology in Spain—which is dependent on the Instituto de Salud Carlos III—regarding the number of COVID-19 cases reported with a certain time lag. These data enabled the identification of anticipatory patterns. RESULTS: In response to the ongoing outbreak, our results demonstrate that by using our correlation test, the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic can be predicted in Spain up to 11 days in advance. CONCLUSIONS: During the epidemic, Google Trends offers the possibility to preempt health care decisions in real time by tracking people's concerns through their search patterns. This can be of great help given the critical, if not dramatic need for complementary monitoring approaches that work on a population level and inform public health decisions in real time. This study of Google search patterns, which was motivated by the fears of individuals in the face of a pandemic, can be useful in anticipating the development of the pandemic."

Plasma sterilization offers a faster, less toxic and versatile alternative to conventional sterilization techniques. 45 kV, 50 kHz high voltage high-frequency power supply was designed for generating DBD plasma. Experimental studies were conducted using DBD plasma on growth control in algae, breakdown of complex phenols for chemical wastewater treatment and generation of UV, ozone and other reactive species using DBD plasma discharges in ambient air. A portable DBD plasma-based sterilization system is developed for fighting the Covid-19 pandemic. Quartz tube is used as a dielectric medium between copper foil—SS electrodes and 17 kV, 30 kHz pulse is applied across it, which produces intense DBD across SS mesh. This system can sterilize and disinfect the microorganism contaminated surfaces, garments and used disposable protective gears with UV, ozone and short-lived molecules of metastable states and excited chemical species of nitrogen and oxygen produced during the DBD plasma discharges in ambient air."

We model an unmitigated scenario and 12 mitigation scenarios which differ in compliance behavior to social distancing strategies and to the duration of the stay-home order. Under each scenario we estimate the number of people who are likely to get infected and require medical attention, hospitalization, and ventilators. Given the per capita medical cost for each of these health states, we compute the total medical costs for each scenario and show the tradeoffs between deaths, costs, infections, compliance and the duration of stay-home order. We also consider the hospital bed capacity of each Hospital Referral Region (HRR) in the US to estimate the deficit in beds each HRR will likely encounter given the demand for hospital beds. We consider a case where HRRs share hospital beds among the neighboring HRRs during a surge in demand beyond the available beds and the impact it has in controlling additional deaths."
679,10012020010727,"This study used social network analysis to investigate the indirect contact network between counties through the movement of live pigs through four wholesale live pig markets in Guangdong Province, China. All 14,118 trade records for January and June 2016 were collected from the markets and the patterns of pig trade in these markets analysed. Maps were developed to show the movement pathways. Evaluating the network between source counties was the primary objective of this study. A 1‐mode network was developed. Characteristics of the trading network were explored, and the degree, betweenness and closeness were calculated for each source county. Models were developed to compare the impacts of different disease control strategies on the potential magnitude of an epidemic spreading through this network. The results show that pigs from 151 counties were delivered to the four wholesale live pig markets in January and/or June 2016. More batches (truckloads of pigs sourced from one or more piggeries) were traded in these markets in January (8,001) than in June 2016 (6,117). The pigs were predominantly sourced from counties inside Guangdong Province (90%), along with counties in Hunan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Fujian and Henan provinces. The major source counties (46 in total) contributed 94% of the total batches during the two‐month study period. Pigs were sourced from piggeries located 10 to 1,417 km from the markets. The distribution of the nodes' degrees in both January and June indicates a free‐scale network property, and the network in January had a higher clustering coefficient (0.54 vs. 0.39) and a shorter average pathway length (1.91 vs. 2.06) than that in June. The most connected counties of the network were in the central, northern and western regions of Guangdong Province. Compared with randomly removing counties from the network, eliminating counties with higher betweenness, degree or closeness resulted in a greater reduction of the magnitude of a potential epidemic. The findings of this study can be used to inform targeted control interventions for disease spread through this live pig market trade network in south China."

A reversed phase C18 Nova Pack® column (125 mm × 4.6 mm i.d., × 3 μm particle size) was used as stationary phase. The mobile phase composition was a mixture of 0.1% diethylamine/acetonitrile (70:30, v/v) at pH 8 in an isocratic mode at flow rate was 1.0 mL/min. Detection was set at 210 nm. Tizanidine was used as an internal standard. The clonidine and tizanidine were extracted from plasma matrix using the deproteinization technique. The developed method exhibited a linear calibration range 100.0-2000 ng/mL and the lower limit of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were 31.0 and 91.9 ng/mL, respectively. The intra-day and inter-day accuracy and precision of the method were within 8.0% and 3.0%, respectively, relative to the nominal concentration. The developed method was validated with respect to linearity, accuracy, precision, and selectivity according to the US Food and drug guideline. Minimal degradation was demonstrated during the determination of clonidine under different stability conditions.

681,10122020128332,"As the COVID-19 pandemic causes unprecedented disruptions in citizens' lives and work, prompting a wide range of responses from governments across the globe. The southern Indian state of Kerala, India's COVID-19 “ground zero”, stands out with a fatality rate at a fraction of other richer Indian states and countries. This has happened despite the state presenting strong vulnerabilities to COVID-19. Using the theoretical lens of frugal innovation, we analyse how the Kerala State Government (KSG) combated the spread of COVID-19. This research uncovers the mechanisms at play as KSG implemented and used frugal technologies as platforms that helped decision making and strategy to fight the pandemic. We find a rich interplay of frugal innovations promoted by the government, in partnership with research institutes and private sector actors, which are cheap and efficacious. The study defines and promotes the concept of government frugal innovation (GFI) and provides valuable insights and tools to help governments navigate and effectively respond to this crisis, encouraging the rest of the world to learn from Kerala's experience. Our conceptual model characterizes GFI as involving collaborative aspects, and holds practical implications beyond the times of crises."
682,10052020059722,"AIMS: Since the pandemic outbreak of COVID‐19, limited information is available on diabetic patients with COVID‐19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 166 COVID‐19 patients at Tongji Hospital (Wuhan) from February 8 to March 21, 2020. Clinical characteristics and outcomes (as of April 4, 2020) were compared among control (group 1), secondary hyperglycaemia (group 2: no diabetes history, FPG levels ≥7.0 mmol/L once and HbA1c values <6.5%) and diabetic (group 3) patients. RESULTS: Compared to group 1, groups 2 and 3 had higher rates of leukocytosis, neutrophilia, lymphocytopenia, eosinopenia, and levels of sCRP, ferritin and d‐dimer (P < 0.05 for all). Group 2 patients have higher levels of LDH, prevalence of liver dysfunction and increased IL‐8 than those in group 1, a higher prevalence of increased IL‐8 was found in group 2 than in group 3 (P < 0.05 for all). The proportions of critical patients in groups 2 and 3 were significantly higher compared to group 1 (38.1%, 32.8% vs. 9.5%, P < 0.05 for both). Groups 2 and 3 had significantly longer hospital stays than group 1, which was nearly one week longer. The composite outcomes risks were 5.47 (1.56–19.82) and 2.61 (0.86–7.88) times greater in group 2 and 3 than in group 1. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperglycemia in both diabetes and secondary hyperglycemia patients with COVID‐19 may indicate poor prognoses. There were differences between secondary hyperglycemia and diabetes patients. We recommend that clinicians pay more attention to the blood glucose status of COVID‐19 patients, even those not diagnosed with diabetes before admission."
683,10082020084905,"CRISPR-Cas13 mediates robust transcript knockdown in human cells through direct RNA targeting. Compared to DNA-targeting CRISPR enzymes like Cas9, RNA targeting by Cas13 is transcript- and strand-specific: It can distinguish and specifically knock-down processed transcripts, alternatively spliced isoforms and overlapping genes, all of which frequently serve different functions. Previously, we identified optimal design rules for RfxCas13d guide RNAs (gRNAs), and developed a computational model to predict gRNA efficacy for all human protein-coding genes. However, there is a growing interest to target other types of transcripts, such as noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) or viral RNAs, and to target transcripts in other commonly-used organisms. Here, we predicted relative Cas13-driven knock-down for gRNAs targeting messenger RNAs and ncRNAs in six model organisms (human, mouse, zebrafish, fly, nematode and flowering plants) and four abundant RNA virus families (SARS-CoV-2, HIV-1, H1N1 influenza and MERS). To allow for more flexible gRNA efficacy prediction, we also developed a web-based application to predict optimal gRNAs for any RNA target entered by the user. Given the lack of Cas13 guide design tools, we anticipate this resource will facilitate CRISPR-Cas13 RNA targeting in common model organisms, emerging viral threats to human health, and novel RNA targets."
684,100820200811645,"BACKGROUND: Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is an important etiologic agent of respiratory tract infection (RTI). This study aimed to describe its genetic diversity and clinical impact in patients attended at a tertiary university hospital in Barcelona from the 2014-2015 to the 2016-2017 seasons, focusing on the emerging duplications in G gene and their structural properties. METHODS: Laboratory-confirmed HMPV were characterized based on partialcoding F and G gene sequences with MEGA.v6.0. Computational analysis of disorder propensity, aggregation propensity and glycosylation sites in viral G predicted protein sequence were carried out. Clinical data was retrospectively reviewed and further associated to virological features. RESULTS: HMPV prevalence was 3%. The 180- and 111-nucleotide duplications occurred in A2c lineage G protein increased in prevalence throughout the study, in addition to short genetic changes observed in other HMPV lineages. The A2c G protein without duplications was calculated to protrude over F protein in 23% of cases and increased to a 39% and a 46% with the 111- and 180-nucleotide duplications, respectively. Children did not seem to be more affected by these mutant viruses, but there was a strong association of these variants to LRTI in adults. DISCUSSION: HMPV presents a high genetic diversity in all lineages. Novel variants carrying duplications might present an evolutionary advantage due to an improved steric shielding, which would have been responsible for the reported increasing prevalence and the association to LRTI in adults."
685,101020201011772,"Although implementation of evidence-based practices takes an average of 17 years, in the context of the global pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) interventions were adopted in a greatly compressed time frame. This rapid uptake creates major challenges for conducting COVID-19 clinical research studies, because quickly evolving standards make it difficult to adapt in real time. The rapid dissemination and implementation of COVID-19 interventions is the realization of goals long pursued by the implementation science community. However, the downside of the rapid implementation is that low-quality evidence with little to no scientific vetting may be quickly integrated into clinical care, resulting in lost opportunities to advance our scientific understanding about how to manage infected patients. In the future, novel adaptive designs embedded into electronic health records (Embedded Quantified, Integrated-into-Practice Trial [EQuIPT] designs) that allow for easier and better access to clinical trials may simultaneously improve care and advance healthcare innovations."

OBJECTIVE: Develop a model that uses administrative and clinical data within 24 h of transfer to predict 30-day in-hospital mortality at an Academic Health Center (AHC). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. We used 30 putative variables in a multiple logistic regression model in the full data set (n = 10,389) to identify 20 candidate variables obtained from the electronic medical record (EMR) within 24 h of admission that were associated with 30-day in-hospital mortality (p < 0.05). These 20 variables were tested using multiple logistic regression and area under the curve (AUC)–receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis to identify an optimal risk threshold score in a randomly split derivation sample (n = 5194) which was then examined in the validation sample (n = 5195). PARTICIPANTS: Ten thousand three hundred eighty-nine patients greater than 18 years transferred to the Indiana University (IU)–Adult Academic Health Center (AHC) between 1/1/2016 and 12/31/2017. MAIN MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, C-statistic, and risk threshold score of the model. KEY RESULTS: The final model was strongly discriminative (C-statistic = 0.90) and had a good fit (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test [X(2) (8) =6.26, p = 0.62]). The positive predictive value for 30-day in-hospital death was 68%; AUC-ROC was 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.89–0.92, p < 0.0001). We identified a risk threshold score of −2.19 that had a maximum sensitivity (79.87%) and specificity (85.24%) in the derivation and validation sample (sensitivity: 75.00%, specificity: 85.71%). In the validation sample, 34.40% (354/1029) of the patients above this threshold died compared to only 2.83% (118/4166) deaths below this threshold. CONCLUSION: This model can use EMR and administrative data within 24 h of transfer to predict the risk of 30-day in-hospital mortality with reasonable accuracy among seriously ill transferred patients.

688,10072020070813,"The tourism sector has numerous intertwined subsectors, with the performance of each critical to the performance of the other. The car rental is critical to the success of the tourism industry, yet it remains under, and thus there is limited knowledge on how the previous pandemic impacted the car rentals industry. This study examines the impact of COVID-19 on the car rental as well as ride and share transport niches of the tourism industry. Making use of secondary and archival data, the study found that the two subsectors lost revenue amounting to billions of dollars in potential revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic resulted in company rating downgrades, market volatility and loss of share value for leading entities such as Hertz, Avis, Europcar, Uber and Lyft. However, the impact of the pandemic on ride and share transport was moderate compared to car rentals. The pandemic led to Hertz filing for bankruptcy, albeit after paying US$16 million in retention bonuses on the eve of bankruptcy to its executives. Losses led to various cost-containment measures, which saw a record number of employees being laid off and disposal of non-core assets. The chapter recommends a robust, coordinated health and safety certification and protocol for the industry to ensure the safety of passengers and employees to boost confidence in the sector as it emerges from the pandemic. Furthermore, a call is made to revisit employment conditions in this sector with the view to provide better protection of employees from the COVID-19 and other disaster-related market shocks. A revision of the current business model is imperative, given the vulnerability of the sector to shock to ensure disaster resilience. Impact assessment post the pandemic will be critical to get a full picture of the impact, particularly on small businesses that were not covered in this study."

The objective of this study was to assess the impact of an interactive anesthesiology educational program on the wellness of anesthesia providers and their children, as assessed by a modified Professional Fulfillment Index. DESIGN Prospective observational study. SETTING Perioperative area. PATIENTS Thirty clinicians participated in the program. Twenty respondents, representing 67% of participants and each corresponding to a parent and their child or children, completed the post-event survey. INTERVENTIONS An interactive anesthesiology educational program incorporating children, between the ages of five and eighteen years old, of anesthesia providers was held in the perioperative area. The program was held over four hours and was comprised of four sessions including pediatric anesthesia, neuroanesthesia, airway, and ultrasound stations. MEASUREMENTS Anesthesia providers and their children were administered a post-event assessment, including a modified Professional Fulfillment Index and satisfaction survey. MAIN RESULTS All twenty (100%) of respondents indicated it was ""very true"" or ""completely true"" that their child was happy with the program, and that it was worthwhile and satisfying to both the anesthesia provider and their child. Nineteen (95%) of reporting participants indicated it was ""very true"" or ""completely true"" that it was meaningful to have the department host such a program and 17 (85%) respondents felt their child now better understands the anesthesia work of the parent. All clinician volunteers indicated it was ""very true"" or ""completely true"" that they were contributing professionally during the program in ways that they valued most. CONCLUSION An interactive educational wellness initiative provides an effective and feasible method for increasing professional fulfillment and satisfaction among anesthesia providers while educating our youngest generation of learners. Implementation of such a program may also occur with modifications such as televideo to maintain COVID-19 precautions."
690,10042020046803,"The newly identified SARS-CoV-2 has now been reported from around 183 countries with more than a million confirmed human cases including more than 68000 deaths. The genomes of SARS-COV-2 strains isolated from different parts of the world are now available and the unique features of constituent genes and proteins have gotten substantial attention recently. Spike glycoprotein is widely considered as a possible target to be explored because of its role during the entry of coronaviruses into host cells. We analyzed 320 whole-genome sequences and 320 spike protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 using multiple sequence alignment tools. In this study, 483 unique variations have been identified among the genomes including 25 non-synonymous mutations and one deletion in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Among the 26 variations detected, 12 variations were located at the N-terminal domain and 6 variations at the receptor-binding domain (RBD) which might alter the interaction with receptor molecules. In addition, 22 amino acid insertions were identified in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with that of SARS-CoV. Phylogenetic analyses of spike protein revealed that Bat coronavirus have a close evolutionary relationship with circulating SARS-CoV-2. The genetic variation analysis data presented in this study can help a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Based on our findings, potential inhibitors can be designed and tested targeting these proposed sites of variation."
691,101120201110044,"Pathogenesis induced by SARS-CoV-2 is thought to result from both an inflammation dominated cytokine response and virus-induced cell perturbation causing cell death. Here, we employ an integrative imaging analysis to determine morphological organelle alterations induced in SARS-CoV-2 infected human lung epithelial cells. We report 3D electron microscopy reconstructions of whole-cells and subcellular compartments, revealing extensive fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus, alteration of the mitochondrial network and recruitment of peroxisomes to viral replication organelles formed by clusters of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs). These are tethered to the endoplasmic reticulum, providing insights into DMV biogenesis and spatial coordination of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Live cell imaging combined with an infection sensor reveals profound remodeling of cytoskeleton elements. Pharmacological inhibition of their dynamics suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication. We thus report insights into virus-induced cytopathic effects, and provide alongside a comprehensive publicly available repository of 3D data-sets of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells for download and smooth online visualization."
692,100920200910173,"Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, worldwide population’s lifestyle has changed dramatically, causing psychosocial consequences. Patients presenting a preexisting chronic condition, as Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), are the ones suffering the most from this situation. Moreover, people affected by diabetes are the ones with the worst prognosis, if infected by SARS-CoV-2. We analyzed why patients with T1D were poorly represented between the subjects hospitalized for COVID-19 and why the cases of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) were fewer and more severe compared with the past years. Furthermore, literature has showed how patients of all ages with T1D did not experience a deterioration in their glucose control throughout the lockdown. Among other causes, this is also due to the surging use of telemedicine. Finally, we tried to understand how the coronavirus tropism for endocrine tissues could influence the future epidemiology of T1D, focusing on the effects they have on pancreatic β-cells."
693,10062020063108,"OBJECTIVE Pressure ulcers (PUs) involve the destruction of skin and underlying tissue due to prolonged pressure and shear forces. These ulcers are painful and significantly reduce a person's quality of life. PUs are also expensive to manage and impact negatively on the achievement of cost-effective, efficient care delivery. METHOD Prone positioning is a postural therapy that aims to enhance respiratory function through increasing oxygenation levels. In contemporary clinical practice, ventilation in the prone position is indicated for patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, despite its advantages in terms of respiratory function, several studies have examined complications of prone position ventilation and have identified PUs (facial PUs as well as PUs on other weight-bearing areas of the body) as a frequent complication in patients who are already in a precarious medical situation. International data suggest that up to 57% of patients nursed in the prone position develop a PU. The aim of this clinical review is to identify and review evidence-based recommendations developed to facilitate the selection and application of preventive interventions aimed at reducing PU development in patients ventilated in the prone position. Given the current COVID-19 crisis, this review is timely as intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID-19 require ventilation in the prone position at a level that is disproportionate to the general intensive care population. Up to 28% of patients admitted to the ICU with confirmed infection due to severe COVID-19 are cared for in the prone position. The scope of this review is limited to adult individuals only. RESULTS The skin assessment should be undertaken before proning and following positioning the patient back into the supine position. Although it is essential to keep the skin clean and moisturised, using pH-balanced cleansers, there is inconsistency in terms of the evidence to support the type of moisturiser. Use of positioning devices in addition to repositioning is recommended to offload pressure points on the face and body. Further, using dressings such as hydrocolloids, transparent film and silicone may be of benefit in decreasing facial skin breakdown. CONCLUSION Given the importance of PU prevention in this cohort of patients, adopting a focused prevention strategy, including skin assessment and care, offloading and pressure redistribution, and dressings for prevention may contribute to a reduction in the incidence and prevalence of these largely preventable wounds."
694,10122020124508,"INTRODUCTION Diabetes mellitus and hypertension are described as the most common comorbidities among COVID-19 patients. We investigated the adverse effect of ACEIs in diabetic and nondiabetic patients with COVID-19. METHODS This prospective study consisted of 617 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 inpatients. Demographic and baseline characteristics, underlying comorbid diseases, and antihypertensive drugs were evaluated. Study outcome (in-hospital death) was evaluated with the Kaplan-Meyer method and Cox regression model. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software for Windows. P values < .05 were considered significant. RESULTS Mean ± SD age was 58.49 ± 15.80 (range: 18 to 94) years old. Cox regression analysis revealed that age (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.06), diabetes mellitus (adjusted HR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.32 to 3.26), immunocompromised patients (adjusted HR = 2.33, 95% CI: 1.29 to 4.21), acute kidney injury (AKI) (adjusted HR = 3.23, 95% CI: 2.01 to 5.19), ICU admission (adjusted HR = 2.48, 95% CI: 1.46 to 4.21), Asthma and COPD (adjusted HR = 2.13, CI:1.6 to 4.28) and ACEI (adjusted HR = 3.08, 95% CI: 1.56 to 6.06), respectively were associated with in-hospital death. Among diabetic patients, ACEI (adjusted HR = 3.51, 95% CI: 1.59 to 7.75), AKI (adjusted HR = 3.32, 95% CI: 1.76 to 6.45) and ICU admission (adjusted HR = 3.64, 95% CI: 1.530 to 8.65) were associated with increased mortality. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed a lower survival rate in diabetic patients with ACE inhibitor (adjusted HR = 3.36, 95% CI: 2.25 to 7.71). CONCLUSION ACEIs may harm the diabetic patient's outcome with COVID-19. Further studies can confirm if ACE inhibitors have an adverse effect on COVID-19 diabetic patient's mortality."
695,10172021053061,"PRACTICAL RELEVANCE Blood and blood products are increasingly available for practitioners to use in the management of haematological conditions, and can be lifesaving and therapeutically useful for patients with anaemia and/or coagulopathies. It is important for feline healthcare that donors are selected appropriately, and transfusions of blood or blood products are given to recipients that will benefit from them. Complications can occur, but can be largely avoided with careful donor management and recipient selection, understanding of blood type compatibility, and transfusion monitoring. CLINICAL CHALLENGES Feline blood transfusion, while potentially a lifesaving procedure, can also be detrimental to donor and recipient without precautions. Cats have naturally occurring alloantibodies to red cell antigens and severe reactions can occur with type-mismatched transfusions. Blood transfusions can also transmit infectious agents to the recipient, so donor testing is essential. Finally, donors must be in good health, and sedated as appropriate, with blood collected in a safe and sterile fashion to optimise the benefit to recipients. Transfusion reactions are possible and can be mild to severe in nature. Autologous blood transfusions and xenotransfusions may be considered in certain situations. EVIDENCE BASE These Guidelines have been created by a panel of authors convened by the International Society of Feline Medicine (ISFM), based on available literature. They are aimed at general practitioners to provide a practical guide to blood typing, cross-matching, and blood collection and administration."
696,10112020112518,"COVID-19 is a pandemic with over 5 million cases worldwide. The disease has imposed a huge burden on health resources. Evaluation of clinical and epidemiological profiles of such patients can help in understanding and managing the outbreak more efficiently. This study was a prospective observational analysis of 200 diagnosed COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary care center from 20th march to 8th May 2020. All these patients were positive for COVID-19 by an oro-nasopharyngeal swab-rtPCR based testing. Analyses of demographic factors, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, laboratory parameters, and the outcomes were performed. The mean age of the population was 40 years with a slight male predominance (116 patients out of 200, 58%). A majority of the patients (147, 73.5 %) were symptomatic, with fever being the most common symptom (109, 54.5%), followed by cough (91, 45.5%). An older age, presence of symptoms and their duration, leukocytosis, a high quick SOFA score, a high modified SOFA score, need for ventilator support, an AST level more than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), and a serum creatinine level of 2 mg/dl or greater were at a significantly higher risk of ICU admission and mortality. Presence of diabetes mellitus, AST > three times ULN, serum creatinine 2 mg/dl or higher, and a qSOFA score of 1 or higher were all associated with significantly greater odds of critical care requirement. Triage and severity assessment helps in deciding the requirement for a hospital stay and ICU admission for COVID-19 which can easily be done using clinical and laboratory parameters. A mild, moderate and severe category approach with defined criteria and treatment guidelines will help in judicious utilization of health-care resources, especially for developing countries like India. *Other members of the Safdarjung Hospital COVID-19 working group: Balvinder Singh (Microbiology), MK Sen (Pulmonary Medicine), Shibdas Chakrabarti (Pulmonary Medicine), NK Gupta (Pulmonary medicine), AJ Mahendran (Pulmonary Medicine), Ramesh Meena (Medicine), G Usha (Anaesthesiology), Santvana Kohli (Anaesthesiology), Sahil Diwan (Anaesthesiology), Rushika Saksena (Microbiology), Vikramjeet Dutta (Microbiology), Anupam Kr Anveshi (Microbiology)."

The mechanism of transmission is agent-to-agent contact, using parameters reported for Corona COVID-19 pandemic. The main goal of the ALPS simulation is analyze effects of preventive measures -- imposition and lifting of lockdown norms -- on the rates of infections, fatalities and recoveries. The model assumptions and choices represent a balance between competing demands of being realistic and being efficient for real-time inferences. The model provides quantification of gains in reducing casualties by imposition and maintenance of restrictive measures in place."
698,10072020079189,"OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to examine perspective and costing approaches used in cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) and the distribution of reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). METHODS: We analyzed the Tufts Medical Center’s CEA and Global Health CEA registries, containing 6907 cost-per-quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) and 698 cost-per-disability-adjusted-life-year (DALY) studies published through 2018. We examined how often published CEAs included non-health consequences and their impact on ICERs. We also reviewed 45 country-specific guidelines to examine recommended analytic perspectives. RESULTS: Study authors often mis-specified or did not clearly state the perspective used. After re-classification by registry reviewers, a healthcare sector or payer perspective was most prevalent (74%). CEAs rarely included unrelated medical costs and impacts on non-healthcare sectors. The most common non-health consequence included was productivity loss in the cost-per-QALY studies (12%) and patient transportation in the cost-per-DALY studies (21%). Of 19,946 cost-per-QALY ratios, the median ICER was $US26,000/QALY (interquartile range [IQR] 2900–110,000), and 18% were cost saving and QALY increasing. Of 5572 cost-per-DALY ratios, the median ICER was $US430/DALY (IQR 67–3400), and 8% were cost saving and DALY averting. Based on 16 cost-per-QALY studies (2017–2018) reporting 68 ICERs from both the healthcare sector and societal perspectives, the median ICER from a societal perspective ($US22,710/QALY [IQR 11,991–49,603]) was more favorable than from a healthcare sector perspective ($US30,402/QALY [IQR 10,486–77,179]). Most governmental guidelines (67%) recommended either a healthcare sector or a payer perspective. CONCLUSION: Researchers should justify and be transparent about their choice of perspective and costing approaches. The use of the impact inventory and reporting of disaggregate outcomes can reduce inconsistencies and confusion.

699,10102020108599,"Although obesity is known to be a risk factor for COVID-19 severity, there is an urgent need to distinguish between different kinds of fat—visceral and subcutaneous fat—and their inflammation status in COVID-19. These different fat types have partially diverging biochemical roles in the human body, and they are differentially associated with SARS-CoV-2, which targets the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell entry. ACE2 is highly expressed in adipose tissue, especially in visceral fat, suggesting an important role for this tissue in determining COVID-19 disease severity. In this perspective article, we discuss group differences in the amount of visceral fat levels and the extent of inflammation in adipocytes of visceral fat tissue, which may, in part, drive population, cross-national, ethnic, and sex differences in COVID-19 disease. It is vital to steer the scientific community’s attention to the effects of visceral fat in creating individual and population differences in COVID-19 severity. This can help researchers unravel the reasons for the reported population, ethnic, and sex differences in COVID-19 severity and mortality."
700,10112020115277,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, as well as the outcomes of children with MIS-C. METHOD: Multicenter, prospective cohort study, conducted in 17 pediatric intensive care units in five states in Brazil, from March to July 2020. Patients from 1 month to 19 years who met the MIS-C diagnostic criteria were included consecutively. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients were included, with the following conditions: Kawasaki-like disease (n = 26), incomplete Kawasaki disease (n = 16), acute cardiac dysfunction (n = 10), toxic shock syndrome (n = 3), and macrophage activation syndrome (n = 1). Median age was 6.2 years (IQR 2.4-10.3), 70% were boys, 59% were non-whites, 20% had comorbidities, 48% reported a contact with COVID-19 cases, and 55% had a recent SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR and/or serology. Gastrointestinal symptoms were present in 71%, shock symptoms in 59%, and severe respiratory symptoms in less than 20%. D-dimer was increased in 80% and cardiac dysfunction markers in more than 75%. Treatment included immunoglobulin (89%); corticosteroids, antibiotics, and enoxaparin in about 50%; and oseltamivir and antifungal therapy in less than 10%. Only 11% needed invasive mechanical ventilation, with a median duration of five days (IQR 5-6.5). The median length of PICU stay was six days (IQR 5-11), and one death occurred (1.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Most characteristics of the present MIS-C patients were similar to that of other cohorts. The present results may contribute to a broader understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and its short-term consequences. Long-term multidisciplinary follow-up is needed, since it is not known whether these patients will have chronic cardiac impairment or other sequelae."
701,10052020052677,"BACKGROUND With technological advances, there has been increasing interest in developing contactless and/or non-invasive wearable technologies that continuously monitor vital signs in the clinical setting, and in particular in the deteriorating patient. These devices as of yet have not been well validated in the clinical setting in the clinical ranges observed in a critically unwell patient. We will perform a systematic review of all novel wearable and contactless devices in the clinical setting with focus on degree of novelty and the range of vital signs captured. METHODS Ovid MEDLINE including Epub Ahead of Print and In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) database (Ovid), CINAHL with Full Text, searches of the grey literature, cited references of eligible studies through Web of Science, and reference lists of eligible studies will be searched. Outcomes of interest will include the quality of studies in relation to reporting guidelines, limitations of non-invasive technology, and application in different clinical populations. We will perform a qualitative assessment of the novelty of the device and discuss its validation in deteriorating patients. DISCUSSION While novel monitoring devices are often proposed as a solution to problems with infection, discomfort, and frequency of monitoring in the clinical setting it has not yet been established which devices have been validated in clinical settings in the pathological ranges of vital signs that reflect patient deterioration. It is equally unclear what additional value these devices might provide. This systematic review will synthesize published data regarding devices that have been tested and validated in patients AND in a clinical setting AND in reference ranges that reflect severe illness.

702,10062020064667,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease initially reported in China and currently worldwide dispersed caused by a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 or 2019-nCoV) affecting more than seven million people around the world causing more than 400 thousand deaths (on June 8(th), 2020). The diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on the clinical and epidemiological history of the patient. However, the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis is the viral detection through the amplification of nucleic acids. Although the quantitative Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) has been described as the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19, there are several difficulties involving its use. Here we comment on RT-PCR and describe alternative tests developed for the diagnosis of COVID-19."
703,10122020123267,"Early life adversity impacts on a range of emotional, cognitive, and psychological processes. A recent theoretical model suggests that at least some of these effects are due to accelerated maturation of specific physiological systems and/or neural circuits. For example, maternal separation (MS), a model of early life adversity in rodents, accelerates maturation of memory systems, and here we examined its impact on maturation of perineuronal nets (PNNs) and parvalbumin (PV)-containing inhibitory interneurons. PNNs are specialized extracellular matrix structures suggested to be involved in stabilizing long-term memories and in the closure of a sensitive period in memory development. PV-containing inhibitory interneurons are the type of cell that PNNs preferentially surround, and are also thought to be involved in memory. In Experiment 1, with male rats, there was an increase in PNNs in both the amygdala and prefrontal cortex with age from infancy to juvenility. Contrary to prediction, MS had no impact on either PNN or PV expression. The same pattern was observed in female rats in Experiment 2. Taken together, these data show that the early maturation of memory in MS infants is not due to an accelerated maturation of PNNs or PV-containing cells in either the amygdala or prefrontal cortex."
704,101720210510330,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, medical education organizations endorsed a virtual recruitment format, representing a stark change from traditional in-person interviews. We aimed to identify the attitudes and perceptions of Gastroenterology Fellowship Program Directors (PDs) and applicants regarding the virtual interview experience and the role of virtual interviews (VI) in the future. METHODS: We designed separate surveys targeting PDs and applicants using the Qualtrics software. At the end of the interview season, we e-mailed both survey links to all PDs and requested that they forward the applicant survey to their interviewed candidates. Surveys were voluntary and anonymous. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data with results presented as percentages. RESULTS: A total of 29.7% of PDs completed the survey. Compared to traditional interviews, VI were viewed by 46.5% of PDs to be very suboptimal or suboptimal. Yet, 69.1% envisioned a role for VI in the future. A total of 14.2% of applicants completed the survey. Compared to traditional interviews, VI were viewed by 42.3% of applicants to be very suboptimal or suboptimal. However, 61.8% saw a future role for VI. While both applicants and PDs reported that establishing an interpersonal connection was a disadvantage with VI, applicants placed more emphasis on this need for connection (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Overall, PDs and applicants report mixed views with regard to VI but anticipate that it may continue to have a future role. VI may augment future recruitment cycles with care taken to not disadvantage applicants, who rely heavily on the interview process to create personal connections with programs.

705,10132021012438,"During the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there was a shortage of masks and respirators for the protection of health care professionals. Masks for noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in combination with viral-proof filters, worn by healthcare workers, could serve as an alternative protection measure. We determined the simulated protection factor (SPF) of such devices in comparison to conventional surgical masks, N95, and FFP3 respirators. Masks and respirators were mounted on a ventilated mannequin head in a test-chamber. Isotonic saline containing 150 MBq 99mTC-DTPA (99mTc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetate (DTPA) was nebulized inside the box. The aerosol had a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 0.6 ± 0.4 µm. SPFs were measured using radioactive DTPA particles in the mannequin test system by calculating the ratio of unfiltered particles (Pu) and filtered particles (Pf) for each tested device (SPF = Pu/Pf). Simulated protection factors were 15.6 ± 3.6 for a ResMed AcuCare mask plus filter, 3.5 ± 0.2 for a ResMed Mirage Quattro FX mask plus filter, 9.5 ± 0.8 for a Loewenstein JOYCEclinc FF mask plus filter, 1.9 ± 0.2 for a surgical mask with a rubber band, 2.7 ± 0.7 for a surgical mask with ribbons, 2.3 ± 0.3 for an FFP3 respirator, and 3.6 ± 1.3 for an N95 respirator. The ResMed AcuCare and the Loewenstein JOYCEclinic FF mask were more effective than any other of the tested devices (p < 0.001). In conclusion, masks normally used for NIV with viral-proof filters can effectively filter respirable particles."
706,101620210411406,"There is evidence that young people generally self-manage their mental health using self-care strategies, coping methods and other self-management techniques, which may better meet their needs or be preferable to attending specialist mental health services. LGBTQ+ young people are more likely than their peers to experience a mental health difficulty and may be less likely to draw on specialist support due to fears of discrimination. However, little is known about LGBTQ+ young people’s experiences and perceptions of self-managing their mental health. Using a multimodal qualitative design, 20 LGBTQ+ young people participated in a telephone interview or an online focus group. A semi-structured schedule was employed to address the research questions, which focussed on LGBTQ+ young people’s experiences and perceptions of self-managing their mental health, what they perceived to stop or help them to self-manage and any perceived challenges to self-management specifically relating to being LGBTQ+ . Reflexive thematic analysis yielded three key themes: (1) self-management strategies and process, (2) barriers to self-management and (3) facilitators to self-management. Participants’ most frequently mentioned self-management strategy was ‘speaking to or meeting up with friends or a partner’. Both barriers and facilitators to self-management were identified which participants perceived to relate to LGBTQ+ identity. Social support, LGBTQ+ youth groups and community support were identified as key facilitators to participants’ self-management of their mental health, which merits further investigation in future research. These findings also have important implications for policy and intervention development concerning LGBTQ+ young people’s mental health."

Data were analysed using Microsoft tools. The 2.000 P1 posts generated 77.654.161 interactions - 70% likes, 4% comments and 27% shares. However, the 2.000 P2 posts prompted more than four times engagement, with 330.930.859 interactions - 92% likes, 2% comments and 6% shares. From January to February, likes increased 59%, but comments and shares decreased by 27% and 57%, respectively: users are generally more engaged but at a less profound level. From May to June, likes, comments and shares decreased 41%, 43% and 51%, as users gradually come out of confinement. Certain events boosted engagement: on January 21, as the first case in the United States was announced, 767.280 interactions were reported, a 21-fold increase from the previous day; February 16 was the day with more monthly engagement when the first case in France was announced. January 25, CNN posted the Facebook post with more interactions of the month (2.510.695). On February, the post with most interactions was from Real Madrid Football Club.

709,10102020107872,"Zoonotic coronaviruses represent an ongoing threat, yet the myriads of circulating animal viruses complicate the identification of higher-risk isolates that threaten human health. Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) is a newly discovered, highly pathogenic virus that likely evolved from closely related HKU2 bat coronaviruses, circulating in Rhinolophus spp. bats in China and elsewhere. As coronaviruses cause severe economic losses in the pork industry and swine are key intermediate hosts of human disease outbreaks, we synthetically resurrected a recombinant virus (rSADS-CoV) as well as a derivative encoding tomato red fluorescent protein (tRFP) in place of ORF3. rSADS-CoV replicated efficiently in a variety of continuous animal and primate cell lines, including human liver and rectal carcinoma cell lines. Of concern, rSADS-CoV also replicated efficiently in several different primary human lung cell types, as well as primary human intestinal cells. rSADS-CoV did not use human coronavirus ACE-2, DPP4, or CD13 receptors for docking and entry. Contemporary human donor sera neutralized the group I human coronavirus NL63, but not rSADS-CoV, suggesting limited human group I coronavirus cross protective herd immunity. Importantly, remdesivir, a broad-spectrum nucleoside analog that is effective against other group 1 and 2 coronaviruses, efficiently blocked rSADS-CoV replication in vitro. rSADS-CoV demonstrated little, if any, replicative capacity in either immune-competent or immunodeficient mice, indicating a critical need for improved animal models. Efficient growth in primary human lung and intestinal cells implicate SADS-CoV as a potential higher-risk emerging coronavirus pathogen that could negatively impact the global economy and human health."
710,10122020122179,"We know that youth who live in low-income households tend to have lower nutritional health outcomes-including higher rates of obesity-when compared to their higher-income counterparts. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is the largest U.S. federal nutrition program and has been found to improve food security and to serve as an income support. It is less clear how SNAP may affect obesity in low-income youth. From a policy perspective, it is essential to understand how the largest federal nutrition assistance program influences the health of children and adolescents. We use the exogenous increase in SNAP benefits that was a part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) to identify how a change in benefits is linked with obesity in youth. We find evidence that the ARRA increase in SNAP benefits is associated with healthier weight outcomes in three of the four age groups examined. SNAP-eligible toddlers are less likely to be overweight and adolescents are less likely to be obese. These findings can help policy makers understand how additional SNAP benefits from the Families First Coronavirus Response Act may influence weight outcomes in children and adolescents."

When restricting the analysis to patients who developed pneumomediastinum during noninvasive ventilation, the difference became clearly significant (0.17/1000 vs 1.36/1000 patient-days, p = 0.039). At logistic regression, predisposing factors (p = 0.031), and COVID-19 radiological severity (p = 0.019) were independently associated with pneumomediastinum. Mortality in patients with pneumomediastinum was 87.5%. However, pneumomediastinum seemed to be related to a generally worse disease presentation in hospitalized patients during the 2nd wave, rather than to a separate pattern of disease."
712,10062020065579,"On March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency to combat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As the number of persons hospitalized with COVID-19 increased, early reports from Austria (1), Hong Kong (2), Italy (3), and California (4) suggested sharp drops in the numbers of persons seeking emergency medical care for other reasons. To quantify the effect of COVID-19 on U.S. emergency department (ED) visits, CDC compared the volume of ED visits during four weeks early in the pandemic March 29-April 25, 2020 (weeks 14 to 17; the early pandemic period) to that during March 31-April 27, 2019 (the comparison period). During the early pandemic period, the total number of U.S. ED visits was 42% lower than during the same period a year earlier, with the largest declines in visits in persons aged ≤14 years, females, and the Northeast region. Health messages that reinforce the importance of immediately seeking care for symptoms of serious conditions, such as myocardial infarction, are needed. To minimize SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, transmission risk and address public concerns about visiting the ED during the pandemic, CDC recommends continued use of virtual visits and triage help lines and adherence to CDC infection control guidance."
713,10052020053569,"Photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy (PACT) is an effective strategy to inactivate pathogenic and resistant microbes. However, pan-microbial photoinactivation has hardly achieved. In this manuscript, we built anti-microbial PSs based on 2,6-diiodo-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl BODIPY (2I-BDP) using anchoring strategy through modifications on boron atom with bis-cationic moieties. With appropriate bis-cationic anchoring, we could achieve effective PACT for pan-microbial photoinactivation via straight forward modifications. Our studies suggested that integration of an efficient photosensitizer, good amphiphilicity, as well as tight interaction with microbial membrane could be essential for effective PACT."
714,101520210310092,"Coordinated local mucosal and systemic immune responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection protect against COVID-19 pathologies or fail leading to severe clinical outcomes. To understand this process, we performed an integrated analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies, cytokines, viral load and 16S bacterial communities in paired nasopharyngeal swabs and plasma samples from a cohort of clinically distinct COVID-19 patients during acute infection. Plasma viral load was associated with systemic inflammatory cytokines that were elevated in severe COVID-19, and also with spike-specific neutralizing antibodies. In contrast, nasopharyngeal viral load correlated with SARS-CoV-2 humoral responses but inversely with interferon responses, the latter associating with protective microbial communities. Potential pathogenic microrganisms, often implicated in secondary respiratory infections, were associated with mucosal inflammation and elevated in severe COVID-19. Our results demonstrate distinct tissue compartmentalization of SARS-CoV-2 immune responses and highlight a role for the nasopharyngeal microbiome in regulating local and systemic immunity that determines COVID-19 clinical outcomes."
715,10112020114169,"The COVID-19 pandemic has influenced virtually all aspects of our lives. Across the world, countries have applied various mitigation strategies for the epidemic, based on social, political, and technological instruments. We postulate that one should {identify the relevant requirements} before committing to a particular mitigation strategy. One way to achieve it is through an overview of what is considered relevant by the general public, and referred to in the media. To this end, we have collected a number of news clips that mention the possible goals and requirements for a mitigation strategy. The snippets are sorted thematically into several categories, such as health-related goals, social and political impact, civil rights, ethical requirements, and so on. In a forthcoming companion paper, we will present a digest of the requirements, derived from the news clips, and a preliminary take on their formal specification."

To guide organizations to design effective workplace interventions to mitigate the negative impacts of COVID-19, we take the occupational health psychology (OHP) perspective to propose a framework that highlights important areas for organizations to intervene in order to better protect workers’ physical health and safety and to promote workers’ psychological well-being. Specifically, we integrate the prevention-based public health model with the Total Worker Health (TWH) and OHP-based approaches to propose a comprehensive set of primary, secondary, and tertiary interventions that target different groups of employees with varied exposure risks to the new coronavirus. We believe these proposed interventions can contribute positively to the development of healthy and safe work. Implications of these proposed interventions for workers, organizations, and policy makers are also discussed."
717,10132021013726,"Motivation For many RNA molecules, the secondary structure is essential for the correct function of the RNA. Predicting RNA secondary structure from nucleotide sequences is a long-standing problem in genomics, but the prediction performance has reached a plateau over time. Traditional RNA secondary structure prediction algorithms are primarily based on thermodynamic models through free energy minimization, which imposes strong prior assumptions and is slow to run. Results Here we propose a deep learning-based method, called UFold, for RNA secondary structure prediction, trained directly on annotated data without any thermodynamic assumptions. UFold improves substantially upon previous models, with approximately 10~30% improvement over traditional thermodynamic models and 14% improvement over other learning-based methods. It achieves an F1 score of 0.91 on base pair prediction accuracy on an RNA structure prediction benchmark dataset. UFold is also fast with an inference time about 160ms per sequence up to 1600bp length. We provide an online web server that implements UFold for RNA structure prediction and is made freely available. Availability An online web server running UFold is available at https://ufold.ics.uci.edu. Code is available at https://github.com/uci-cbcl/UFold. Contact xhx@uci.edu"

719,10132021014049,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) demonstrated the need for accurate and fast diagnosis methods for emergent viral diseases. Soon after the emergence of COVID-19, medical practitioners used X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images of patients' lungs to detect COVID-19. Machine learning methods are capable of improving the identification accuracy of COVID-19 in X-ray and CT images, delivering near real-time results, while alleviating the burden on medical practitioners. In this work, we demonstrate the efficacy of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, trained with a combination of deep convolutional and handcrafted features extracted from X-ray chest scans. We use this combination of features to discriminate between healthy, common pneumonia, and COVID-19 patients. The performance of the combined feature approach is compared with a standard convolutional neural network (CNN) and the SVM trained with handcrafted features. We find that combining the features in our novel framework improves the performance of the classification task compared to the independent application of convolutional and handcrafted features. Specifically, we achieve an accuracy of 0.988 in the classification task with our combined approach compared to 0.963 and 0.983 accuracy for the handcrafted features with SVM and CNN respectively."
720,10092020096300,"Continuous exposure to human activity has led to considerable behavioural changes in some wildlife populations. Animals are more likely to survive in a changing environment by adjusting their behaviour to repeatedly occurring but harmless stimulations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, starting in late 2019, face masks were recommended to the public to prevent the spread of pathogens. In this context, we compared the flight initiation distance (FID) of the Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus), a commonly seen bird across China, in Yibin and Dazhou, Sichuan, in response to people with or without face masks. After continuous exposure to people wearing face masks for nearly six months, sparrows evidently became adapted to people wearing face masks, and correspondingly showed shorter FIDs in response to people wearing masks. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that birds show reduced fear responses to people wearing face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results suggest a novel aspect of short-term adaptation of wildlife to human behaviour, and that the learning ability of sparrows allows them to adjust their behaviours to adapt to such subtle changes in the environment."

722,10102020109687,"To evaluate the public interest in rheumatic diseases during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Google Trends was queried to analyze search trends in the United States for numerous rheumatic diseases and also the interest in a rheumatologist. Three 8-week periods in 2020 ((March 15–May 9), (May 10–July 4), and (July 5–August 29)) were compared to similar periods of the prior 4 years (2016–2019). Compared to a similar time period between 2016 and 2019, a significant decrease was found in the relative search volume for more than half of the search terms during the initial March 15–May 9, 2020 period. However, this trend appeared to reverse during the July 5–August 29, 2020 period where the relative volume for nearly half of the search terms were not statistically significant compared to similar periods of the prior 4 years. In addition, this period showed a significant increase in relative volume for the terms: Axial spondyloarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren’s syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome, scleroderma, Kawasaki disease, Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, and rheumatologist. There was a significant decrease in relative search volume for many rheumatic diseases between March 15 and May 9, 2020 when compared to similar periods during the prior 4 years. However, the trends reversed after the initial period ended. There was an increase in relative search for the term “rheumatologist” between July and August 2020 suggesting the need for rheumatologists during the COVID-19 pandemic. Policymakers and healthcare providers should address the informational demands on rheumatic diseases and needs for rheumatologists by the general public during pandemics like COVID-19."
723,10072020078297,"Digital Microfluidic Biochips (DMFBs) will require error-free synthesis techniques which can function at much higher speed while implementing on real-time systems and capable of tackling more complex assay operations. Until now various bio-assays are successfully implemented based on different mixing modules present on such lab-on-chips. In present work, the concept of such dedicated virtual modules has been eliminated and a novel module-less-synthesis (MLS) method is proposed for accomplishing high-performance bio-protocols. Various shift-patterns (movements) of the micro-droplets are identified to accomplish entire mixing in lesser time compared to earlier module-based synthesis methods. We have also computed the percentage of mixing accomplishment for each directional-shift of the mixer-droplet. However, path congestion problem and operational errors are inevitable in MLS approach. Hence, the path congestion and washing problem in MLS is addressed by tweaking the earlier MLS approach and a new modified-MLS (MMLS) method is proposed. Finally, washing optimization technique on MMLS method is also given. Different real-life bio assays like PCR, IVD are tested with the proposed technique as well as synthetic benchmarks (hard test benches) are also incorporated in the experiments. For both kind of benchmarks synthesis performance improved with bioassay completion time ([Formula: see text] ) significantly reduced compared to existing synthesis approaches on DMFB platform."
724,10052020054206,"This paper studies an optimal investing problem for a retiree facing longevity risk and living standard risk. We formulate the investing problem as a portfolio choice problem under a time-varying risk capacity constraint. We derive the optimal investment strategy under the specific condition on model parameters in terms of second-order ordinary differential equations. We demonstrate an endogenous number that measures the expected value to sustain the spending post-retirement. The optimal portfolio is nearly neutral to the stock market movement if the portfolio's value is higher than this number; but, if the portfolio is not worth enough to sustain the retirement spending, the retiree actively invests in the stock market for the higher expected return. Besides, we solve an optimal portfolio choice problem under a leverage constraint and show that the optimal portfolio would lose significantly in stressed markets. This paper shows that the time-varying risk capacity constraint has important implications for asset allocation in retirement."

Using lineage tracing, we demonstrate that paired related homeobox 1 (Prrx1)-expressing fibroblasts are responsible for acute and chronic fibroses in the ventral dermis. Single-cell transcriptomics further corroborated the inherent fibrotic characteristics of Prrx1 fibroblasts during wound repair. In summary, we identify and characterize a fibroblast subpopulation in the mouse ventral dermis with intrinsic scar-forming potential."
726,10122020125616,"Understanding the nature of immunity following mild/asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 is crucial to controlling the pandemic. We analyzed T cell and neutralizing antibody responses in 136 healthcare workers (HCW) 16-18 weeks after United Kingdom lockdown, 76 of whom had mild/asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection captured by serial sampling. Neutralizing antibodies (nAb) were present in 89% of previously infected HCW. T cell responses tended to be lower following asymptomatic infection than in those reporting case-definition symptoms of COVID-19, while nAb titers were maintained irrespective of symptoms. T cell and antibody responses were sometimes discordant. Eleven percent lacked nAb and had undetectable T cell responses to spike protein but had T cells reactive with other SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Our findings suggest that the majority of individuals with mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection carry nAb complemented by multispecific T cell responses at 16-18 weeks after mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection."
727,10062020062216,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a global health burden and a major cause of disability and mortality. An early cascade of physical and structural damaging events starts immediately post-TBI. This primary injury event initiates a series of neuropathological molecular and biochemical secondary injury sequelae, that last much longer and involve disruption of cerebral metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and can lead to neuronal damage and death. Coupled to these events, recent studies have shown that lifestyle factors, including diet, constitute additional risk affecting TBI consequences and neuropathophysiological outcomes. There exists molecular cross-talk among the pathways involved in neuronal survival, neuroinflammation, and behavioral outcomes, that are shared among western diet (WD) intake and TBI pathophysiology. As such, poor dietary intake would be expected to exacerbate the secondary damage in TBI. Hence, the aim of this review is to discuss the pathophysiological consequences of WD that can lead to the exacerbation of TBI outcomes. We dissect the role of mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neuronal injury in this context. We show that currently available data conclude that intake of a diet saturated in fats, pre- or post-TBI, aggravates TBI, precludes recovery from brain trauma, and reduces the response to treatment."

In this study, based on the analysis of numerous references and selected methods of computational chemistry, the strategy of integrative structural modification of small-molecules with antiviral activity into potential active complex molecules has been presented. Proposed molecules have been designed based on the structure of triterpene oleanolic acid and complemented by structures characteristic of selected anti-COVID therapy assisted drugs. Their pharmaceutical molecular parameters and the preliminary bioactivity were calculated and predicted. The results of the above analyses show that among the designed complex substances there are potential antiviral agents directed mainly on SARS-CoV-2."
729,10032020031292,"Importance Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide since December 2019. However, information on cardiac injury in patients affected by COVID-19 is limited. Objective To explore the association between cardiac injury and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study was conducted from January 20, 2020, to February 10, 2020, in a single center at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; the final date of follow-up was February 15, 2020. All consecutive inpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study. Main Outcomes and Measures Clinical laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of patients with and without cardiac injury were compared. The association between cardiac injury and mortality was analyzed. Results A total of 416 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were included in the final analysis; the median age was 64 years (range, 21-95 years), and 211 (50.7%) were female. Common symptoms included fever (334 patients [80.3%]), cough (144 [34.6%]), and shortness of breath (117 [28.1%]). A total of 82 patients (19.7%) had cardiac injury, and compared with patients without cardiac injury, these patients were older (median [range] age, 74 [34-95] vs 60 [21-90] years; P < .001); had more comorbidities (eg, hypertension in 49 of 82 [59.8%] vs 78 of 334 [23.4%]; P < .001); had higher leukocyte counts (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 9400 [6900-13 800] vs 5500 [4200-7400] cells/μL) and levels of C-reactive protein (median [IQR], 10.2 [6.4-17.0] vs 3.7 [1.0-7.3] mg/dL), procalcitonin (median [IQR], 0.27 [0.10-1.22] vs 0.06 [0.03-0.10] ng/mL), creatinine kinase-myocardial band (median [IQR], 3.2 [1.8-6.2] vs 0.9 [0.6-1.3] ng/mL), myohemoglobin (median [IQR], 128 [68-305] vs 39 [27-65] μg/L), high-sensitivity troponin I (median [IQR], 0.19 [0.08-1.12] vs <0.006 [<0.006-0.009] μg/L), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (median [IQR], 1689 [698-3327] vs 139 [51-335] pg/mL), aspartate aminotransferase (median [IQR], 40 [27-60] vs 29 [21-40] U/L), and creatinine (median [IQR], 1.15 [0.72-1.92] vs 0.64 [0.54-0.78] mg/dL); and had a higher proportion of multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity in radiographic findings (53 of 82 patients [64.6%] vs 15 of 334 patients [4.5%]). Greater proportions of patients with cardiac injury required noninvasive mechanical ventilation (38 of 82 [46.3%] vs 13 of 334 [3.9%]; P < .001) or invasive mechanical ventilation (18 of 82 [22.0%] vs 14 of 334 [4.2%]; P < .001) than those without cardiac injury. Complications were more common in patients with cardiac injury than those without cardiac injury and included acute respiratory distress syndrome (48 of 82 [58.5%] vs 49 of 334 [14.7%]; P < .001), acute kidney injury (7 of 82 [8.5%] vs 1 of 334 [0.3%]; P < .001), electrolyte disturbances (13 of 82 [15.9%] vs 17 of 334 [5.1%]; P = .003), hypoproteinemia (11 of 82 [13.4%] vs 16 of 334 [4.8%]; P = .01), and coagulation disorders (6 of 82 [7.3%] vs 6 of 334 [1.8%]; P = .02). Patients with cardiac injury had higher mortality than those without cardiac injury (42 of 82 [51.2%] vs 15 of 334 [4.5%]; P < .001). In a Cox regression model, patients with vs those without cardiac injury were at a higher risk of death, both during the time from symptom onset (hazard ratio, 4.26 [95% CI, 1.92-9.49]) and from admission to end point (hazard ratio, 3.41 [95% CI, 1.62-7.16]). Conclusions and Relevance Cardiac injury is a common condition among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, and it is associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality."
730,10092020099033,"Rapid COVID-19 diagnosis in hospital is essential, though complicated by 30-50% of nose/throat swabs being negative by SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). Furthermore, the D614G spike mutant now dominates the pandemic and it is unclear how serological tests designed to detect anti-Spike antibodies perform against this variant. We assess the diagnostic accuracy of combined rapid antibody point of care (POC) and nucleic acid assays for suspected COVID-19 disease due to either wild type or the D614G spike mutant SARS-CoV-2. The overall detection rate for COVID-19 is 79.2% (95CI 57.8-92.9%) by rapid NAAT alone. Combined point of care antibody test and rapid NAAT is not impacted by D614G and results in very high sensitivity for COVID-19 diagnosis with very high specificity."
731,10102020101230,"To counter the outbreak of COVID-19, the accurate diagnosis of suspected cases plays a crucial role in timely quarantine, medical treatment, and preventing the spread of the pandemic. Considering the limited training cases and resources (e.g, time and budget), we propose a Multi-task Multi-slice Deep Learning System ( M3Lung-Sys) for multi-class lung pneumonia screening from CT imaging, which only consists of two 2D CNN networks, i.e., slice- and patient-level classification networks. The former aims to seek the feature representations from abundant CT slices instead of limited CT volumes, and for the overall pneumonia screening, the latter one could recover the temporal information by feature refinement and aggregation between different slices. In addition to distinguish COVID-19 from Healthy, H1N1, and CAP cases, our M3Lung-Sys also be able to locate the areas of relevant lesions, without any pixel-level annotation. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on a chest CT imaging dataset with a total of 734 patients (251 healthy people, 245 COVID-19 patients, 105 H1N1 patients, and 133 CAP patients). The quantitative results with plenty of metrics indicate the superiority of our proposed model on both slice- and patient-level classification tasks. More importantly, the generated lesion location maps make our system interpretable and more valuable to clinicians."

734,10162021040749,"Background: The emergence and resurgence of zoonotic diseases have continued to be a major threat to global health and the economy. Developing countries are particularly vulnerable due to agricultural expansions and domestication of animals with humans. Scientifically sound clinical trials are important to find better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat zoonotic diseases, while there is a lack of evidence to inform the clinical trials' capacity and practice in countries highly affected with the diseases. This study aimed to investigate expert scientists' perceptions and experiences in conducting clinical trials toward zoonotic diseases in Ethiopia. Methods: This study employed a descriptive, qualitative study design. It included major academic and research institutions in Ethiopia that had active engagements in veterinary and public health researches. It included the National Veterinary Institute, the National Animal Health Diagnostic and Investigation Center, the College of Veterinary Medicine at Addis Ababa University, the Ethiopian Public Health Institute, the Armauer Hansen Research Institute, and the College of Health Sciences at Addis Ababa University. In-depth interviews were conducted with expert scientists. Data were collected from October 2019 to April 2020. Data analysis was undertaken using open code 4.03 for qualitative data analysis. Results: Five major themes, with 18 sub-themes, emerged from the in-depth interviews. These were: challenges in the prevention, control, and treatment of zoonotic diseases; One Health approach to mitigate zoonotic diseases; personal and institutional experiences in conducting clinical trials on zoonotic diseases; barriers in conducting clinical trials toward zoonotic diseases; and strategies that promote conducting clinical trials on zoonotic diseases. Conducting clinical trials on zoonotic diseases in Ethiopia is hampered by a lack of clearly articulated ethics and regulatory frameworks, trial experts, financial resources, and good governance. Conclusion: In Ethiopia, conducting clinical trials on zoonotic diseases deserves due attention. Strengthening institutional and human resources capacity is a pre-condition to harness effective implementation of clinical trials on zoonotic diseases in the country. In Ethiopia where skilled human resource is scarce, One Health approach has the potential to form multidisciplinary teams to systematically improve clinical trials capacity and outcomes in the country."
735,10092020091484,"Since March 2020, Spain (along with many other countries) has been severely affected by the ongoing coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the rapid spread of a new virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; SARS-CoV-2). As part of global efforts to improve disease surveillance, we investigated how readily SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected in environmental samples collected from an isolated rural community in Spain with a high COVID-19 prevalence (6% of the population of 883 inhabitants). The first diagnosis of COVID-19-compatible symptoms in the village was recorded on March 3, 2020 and the last known active case resolved on June 5, 2020. By May 15, two months after strict movement constraints were imposed (""lockdown"") the cumulative number of symptomatic cases had increased to 53. Of those cases, 22 (41%) had been tested and confirmed by RT-PCR. On May 13 and June 5, samples were collected from high-use surfaces and clothes in the homes of 13 confirmed cases, from surfaces in nine public service sites (e.g. supermarket and petrol station), and from the wastewater of the village sewage system. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 7 of 57 (12%) samples, including three households and three public sites. While there is not yet sufficient evidence to recommend environmental surveillance as a standard approach for COVID-19 epidemiology, environmental surveillance research may contribute to advance knowledge about COVID-19 by further elucidating virus shedding dynamics and environmental contamination, including the potential identification of animal reservoirs."
736,10082020084736,"When preparing for the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and its effects on the CNS, radiologists should be familiar with neuroimaging appearances in past zoonotic infectious disease outbreaks. Organisms that have crossed the species barrier from animals to humans include viruses such as Hendra, Nipah, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, and influenza, as well as bacteria and others. Brain CT and MR imaging findings have included cortical abnormalities, microinfarction in the white matter, large-vessel occlusion, and features of meningitis. In particular, the high sensitivity of diffusion-weighted MR imaging in detecting intracranial abnormalities has been helpful in outbreaks. Although the coronaviruses causing the previous Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak and the current coronavirus disease 19 pandemic are related, it is important to be aware of their similarities as well as potential differences. This review describes the neuroimaging appearances of selected zoonotic outbreaks so that neuroradiologists can better understand the current pandemic and potential future outbreaks."
737,101020201011941,"BACKGROUND: Primary herpetic gingivostomatitis (PHGS) in children, though usually self-limited, might mimic bacterial and enteroviral pharyngitis clinically. We conducted a study to define the clinical features of PHGS in children. METHODS: Between January 2012 and December 2016, 282 inpatients aged less than 19 years with cell culture-confirmed herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection in a medical center were identified from the virologic laboratory logbook. Clinical data were retrospectively collected. RESULTS: Among the 282 inpatients, 185 cases were considered as PHGS and were included for analysis. Fever was present in 99.5%. The mean duration of fever was 5.11 days (±2.24) with the longest being 17 days. Common oral manifestations included oral ulcers (84.3%), which equally resided in the anterior and posterior part of the oral cavity (65.4% vs. 63.2%), gum swelling and/or bleeding (67.6%), and exudate coated tonsils (16.8%). Leukocytosis (WBC count > 15,000/uL(3)) was noted in 52 patients (28.1%) and a serum C-reactive protein level > 40 mg/L in 55 patients (29.7%). Fixty-five patients (35%) were diagnosed with PHGS on admission and were significantly more likely to have ulcers over the anterior oral cavity (76.1% vs. 26.7%) and gum swelling/bleeding (76.2% vs. 7.5%, p-value all < 0.001) on admission and were significantly less likely to receive antibiotic treatment (16.9 vs. 36.7%, p-value < 0.01) than others. Forty-six patients (25%) undiagnosed as PHGS on discharge were significantly more likely to have exudate coated on the tonsils, to receive antibiotic treatment and significantly less likely to have gum swelling/bleeding and oral ulcers (all p-values < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Meticulously identifying specific oral manifestations of gum swelling/bleeding and ulcers over the anterior oral cavity in children can help making the diagnosis of PHGS earlier and subsequently reduce unnecessary prescription of antibiotics."

A key aspect of the grieving process is the integration of the loss in the bereaved survivor’s life story, identity change, and a new future orientation through meaning attribution. Meaning attribution can have favourable or unfavourable effects on the grieving process and hence determines the extent to which a loss disrupts the bereaved survivor’s functioning. A framework of meaning attribution after loss is presented, comprising 17 determinants that fall into five categories: event-related, cultural, social, individual and relational determinants. Each determinant may lead to both positive and negative meanings, thereby facilitating or complicating the grieving process. The framework of meaning attribution highlights the importance of an integrated network for mental health care, spiritual care, and end-of-life care in the prevention and treatment of traumatic grief. It also emphasizes the support from relatives, collective rituals, cultural views, legal settlements, and other societal factors that may foster or impede adaptation to loss. The framework of meaning attribution informs research across a range of research themes, including specialist care for traumatic grief, a culturally sensitive care network for traumatic grief, and improving care for ambiguous loss in a global context."
739,100820200811876,"Abstract Objectives Several serological SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays have been developed recently but require external validation before widespread use. This study aims at assessing the analytical and clinical performances of the iFlash® anti-SARS-CoV-2 chemiluminescence assay for the detection of both IgM and IgG antibodies. The kinetics of the antibody response was also evaluated. Design & Methods The precision, carry-over, linearity, limit of blank, detection and quantification were assessed. Sensitivity analysis was performed by using 178 sera collected from 154 RT-PCR confirmed patients COVID-19 samples. The specificity analysis was performed from 75 selected non-SARS-CoV-2 sera with a potential cross-reaction to the SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay. Results This iFlash® SARS-CoV-2 assay showed excellent analytical performances. After 2 weeks since symptom onset, the sensitivities for IgM and IgG were 62.2% (95% CI: 52.3-71.2%) and 92.9%% (95% CI: 85.7-96.7%), respectively by using the cut-off provided by the manufacturer. After cut-off optimization (i.e. >2.81 for IgM and >4.86 for IgG), the sensitivity for IgM and IgG were 81.6 (95% CI: 72.7-88.1%) and 95.9% (95% CI: 89.4-98.7%), respectively. Optimized cut-off for IgG improved the sensitivity to reach 100% (95%CI: 87.6-100) from 28 days since symptom onset. Conclusions This study shows that the iFlash® SARS-CoV-2 assay from YHLO biotechnology, has satisfactory analytical performances. Nevertheless, the sensitivity of the IgM is limited for a proper clinical use compared to IgG. The determination of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies from 28 days since symptom onset was associated with high sensitivity, especially using optimized cut-offs (i.e. 100%)."
740,10062020065592,"The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic presents a global challenge for managing acutely ill patients and complications from viral infection. Systemic inflammation accompanied by a “cytokine storm,” hemostasis alterations and severe vasculitis have all been reported to occur with COVID‐19, and emerging evidence suggests that dysregulation of lipid transport may contribute to some of these complications. Here, we aim to summarize the current understanding of the potential mechanisms related to COVID‐19 dyslipidemia and propose possible adjunctive type therapeutic approaches that modulate lipids and lipoproteins. Specifically, we hypothesize that changes in the quantity and composition of high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) that occurs with COVID‐19 can significantly decrease the anti‐inflammatory and anti‐oxidative functions of HDL and could contribute to pulmonary inflammation. Furthermore, we propose that lipoproteins with oxidized phospholipids and fatty acids could lead to virus‐associated organ damage via overactivation of innate immune scavenger receptors. Restoring lipoprotein function with ApoA‐I raising agents or blocking relevant scavenger receptors with neutralizing antibodies could, therefore, be of value in the treatment of COVID‐19. Finally, we discuss the role of omega‐3 fatty acids transported by lipoproteins in generating specialized proresolving mediators and how together with anti‐inflammatory drugs, they could decrease inflammation and thrombotic complications associated with COVID‐19."
741,10122020122192,"OBJECTIVES Monitoring cerebral autoregulation may help identify the lower limit of autoregulation in individual patients. Mean arterial blood pressure below lower limit of autoregulation appears to be a risk factor for postoperative acute kidney injury. Cerebral autoregulation can be monitored in real time using correlation approaches. However, the precise thresholds for different cerebral autoregulation indexes that identify the lower limit of autoregulation are unknown. We identified thresholds for intact autoregulation in patients during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery and examined the relevance of these thresholds to postoperative acute kidney injury. DESIGN A single-center retrospective analysis. SETTING Tertiary academic medical center. PATIENTS Data from 59 patients was used to determine precise cerebral autoregulation thresholds for identification of the lower limit of autoregulation. These thresholds were validated in a larger cohort of 226 patients. METHODS AND MAIN RESULTS Invasive mean arterial blood pressure, cerebral blood flow velocities, regional cortical oxygen saturation, and total hemoglobin were recorded simultaneously. Three cerebral autoregulation indices were calculated, including mean flow index, cerebral oximetry index, and hemoglobin volume index. Cerebral autoregulation curves for the three indices were plotted, and thresholds for each index were used to generate threshold- and index-specific lower limit of autoregulations. A reference lower limit of autoregulation could be identified in 59 patients by plotting cerebral blood flow velocity against mean arterial blood pressure to generate gold-standard Lassen curves. The lower limit of autoregulations defined at each threshold were compared with the gold-standard lower limit of autoregulation determined from Lassen curves. The results identified the following thresholds: mean flow index (0.45), cerebral oximetry index (0.35), and hemoglobin volume index (0.3). We then calculated the product of magnitude and duration of mean arterial blood pressure less than lower limit of autoregulation in a larger cohort of 226 patients. When using the lower limit of autoregulations identified by the optimal thresholds above, mean arterial blood pressure less than lower limit of autoregulation was greater in patients with acute kidney injury than in those without acute kidney injury. CONCLUSIONS This study identified thresholds of intact and impaired cerebral autoregulation for three indices and showed that mean arterial blood pressure below lower limit of autoregulation is a risk factor for acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery."
742,101520210310079,"The presented research aimed to identify the impacts of the second wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on respondents’ mental health state and identify variables related to the respondents’ symptoms of anxiety and depression; 618 subjects participated in the research. A specially prepared survey and Polish adaptations of the following methods were used: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS 10), MINI-COPE Questionnaire (Brief COPE Inventory), Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT), Scale of Death Anxiety (SDA), The Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S). Over 24% of the respondents reported having experienced suicidal thoughts since the start of the pandemic. Almost 16% drank alcohol in a risky or harmful way. The average value of perceived stress indicated its high and very high intensity. Over 20% had symptoms of anxiety disorders, and almost 19% had anxiety and depression symptoms. It means that almost 40% of the respondents probably have mental disorders. More women, younger people, and those with disorders prior to the onset of the pandemic were among those who manifested these disorders. They also used passive and avoidance stress coping strategies more frequently. In conclusion, the second wave of the pandemic negatively affected the mental health of the respondents. A high percentage of the respondents manifested anxiety and anxiety-depressive disorders and declared having of suicidal thoughts."
743,10112020114182,"Background: On March 19, 2020, the government of California ordered all 40 million Californians to stay at home in the coming weeks as the result of the escalation of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As lockdowns were implemented, the significant changes caused by these restrictions brought a dramatic improvement in air quality in metropolitan cities such as Los Angeles (LA Basin).Methods: We use real-time data from The South Coast Air Quality Management District (South Coast AQMD), and the California Department of Transportation to evaluate the drivers of the pollution sources. We also mapped monthly spatial variations and constructed hourly heatmaps of those pollutants in 2020 to understand the impacts of the lockdown on different locations and times of day in the LA Basin. Results: Compared to the same dates in 2019, traffic flow on highways in the Los Angeles Basin dropped by 20.86 % when the stay at home order was initiated and it continued to decrease along with dramatic declines in NO2, CO, and PM2.5. The correlation (Pierson r) between truck flow change and changes of NO2, CO, and PM2.5 is statistically significant. Conclusion: The declines in truck flow are mainly responsible for the drop of NO2 and CO, with traffic having a slightly smaller effect on PM2.5. The lockdowns provided a large-scale experiment into air quality research. The result of this research would provide an important reference for the policy markers regarding truck management in light of air quality control to prepare for the 2028 Summer Olympics in LA."
744,10052020053582,"Background With the emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), health care preparedness has received increasing attention, which requires valid tools to assess the knowledge and attitude of health workers, such as nurses, with regard to this disease. Aims This study aimed to develop and evaluate a knowledge and attitudes questionnaire on MERS coronavirus for Iranian nurses. Methods A questionnaire was developed based on international and national guidelines and a literature review. Ten nurses were recruited to assess face validity and 11 experts reviewed the instrument to determine the content validity ratio and index. Exploratory factor analysis was then done with a random sample of 155 nurses in Tabriz city, Islamic Republic of Iran. Results Following determination of face and content validity, 78 items (61 knowledge and 17 attitude) were retained in the final version of the questionnaire. The knowledge scale had an average content validity index of 0.80 and the attitude scale a value of 0.91. In the exploratory factor analysis, five dimensions with eigenvalues > 1 and loading level ≥ 0.4 were extracted for the knowledge scale (46 items) and two for the attitude scale (16 items). The Kuder-Richardson 21 coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficient for the knowledge scale were 0.94 and 0.91 respectively. In the attitude scale, the Cronbach alpha coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.82 and 0.89 respectively. Conclusions The scale developed in this study is reliable and stable and a suitable instrument for evaluating the knowledge and attitude of nurses about MERS-CoV."
745,10172021052394,"BACKGROUND Despite prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination being a safe, effective and cost-effective public health intervention for the prevention of cervical cancer, the HPV vaccine is not actively recommended or promoted by the Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare in Japan. With already very low levels of cervical screening below 30%, and vaccination levels that are below levels that award any population effect at 0.3% of the eligible population, cervical cancer mortality is higher than other similar high-income countries at 4.4/100,000 (2900) deaths per year in 2015. There is limited population-based or nationally representative data for HPV genotype distribution in Japan, thus making an assessment of the burden of vaccine-preventable cervical cancer difficult. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to determine the HPV genotype prevalence and age distribution of HPV infection in women with a cytological or histological diagnosis of normal through cervical cancer in Japan. We anticipate this information will guide and enhance programme interventions to reduce vaccine-preventable cervical cancer mortality in Japan. METHODS PubMed, Embase and the Japan Medical Abstract Society Database will be searched from the date of establishment to March 2021 to identify original research articles that report the prevalence of HPV genotypes in Japanese women with normal cervical cytology, low grade, high grade and cancerous cervical lesions. No exclusion criteria relating to language or publication date will be applied. The quality of the studies will be assessed using the Joanna Briggs checklist for prevalence studies. Randomised control trials, cohort studies, cross-sectional and prevalence studies will be considered eligible. Study findings will be combined using a traditional random-effects or fixed-effects meta-analysis to summarise pooled prevalence and 95% confidence intervals depending on heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression will be used to investigate heterogeneity, and sensitivity analyses will be conducted to assess the robustness of the findings. DISCUSSION To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review protocol that includes both Japanese and English peer-reviewed articles for the determination of genotype-specific HPV prevalence in cytological or histological confirmed normal cervical specimens, low- and high-grade intraepithelial lesions and cervical cancers by age in Japan. We anticipate this information will guide and enhance programme interventions to reduce vaccine-preventable cervical cancer mortality in Japan.

747,10162021048315,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been raging for over a year, creating global detrimental impact. The BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine has demonstrated high protection levels, yet apprehension exists that several variants of concerns (VOCs) can surmount the immune defenses generated by the vaccines. Neutralization assays have revealed some reduction in neutralization of VOCs B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, but the relevance of these assays in real life remains unclear. Here, we performed a case-control study that examined whether BNT162b2 vaccinees with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection were more likely to become infected with B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 compared with unvaccinated individuals. Vaccinees infected at least a week after the second dose were disproportionally infected with B.1.351 (odds ratio of 8:1). Those infected between two weeks after the first dose and one week after the second dose, were disproportionally infected by B.1.1.7 (odds ratio of 26:10), suggesting reduced vaccine effectiveness against both VOCs under different dosage/timing conditions. Nevertheless, the B.1.351 incidence in Israel to-date remains low and vaccine effectiveness remains high against B.1.1.7, among those fully vaccinated. These results overall suggest that vaccine breakthrough infection is more frequent with both VOCs, yet a combination of mass-vaccination with two doses coupled with non-pharmaceutical interventions control and contain their spread."
748,100920200911286,"SARS-CoV-2 infection is a new threat to global public health in the 21(st) century (2020), which has now rapidly spread around the globe causing severe pneumonia often linked to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and hyperinflammatory syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious through saliva droplets. The structural analysis suggests that the virus enters human cells through the ligation of the spike protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE(2)). The progression of Covid-19 has been divided into three main stages: stage I—viral response, stage II—pulmonary phase, and stage III—hyperinflammation phase. Once the patients enter stage III, it will likely need ventilation and it becomes difficult to manage. Thus, it will be of paramount importance to find therapies to prevent or slow down the progression of the disease toward stage III. The key event leading to hyperinflammation seems to be the activation of Th-17 immunity response and Cytokine storm. B(2)-adrenergic receptors (B(2)ARs) are expressed on airways and on all the immune cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, B and T lymphocytes. Blocking (B(2)AR) has been proven, also in clinical settings, to reduce Th-17 response and negatively modulate inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 while increasing IFNγ. Non-selective beta-blockers are currently used to treat several diseases and have been proven to reduce stress-induced inflammation and reduce anxiety. For these reasons, we speculate that targeting B(2)AR in the early phase of Covid-19 might be beneficial to prevent hyperinflammation."
749,100720200712569,"OBJECTIVE: To describe social distancing practices in nine municipalities of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, stratified by gender, age, and educational attainment. METHODS: Two sequential cross-sectional studies were conducted in the municipalities of Canoas, Caxias do Sul, Ijuí, Passo Fundo, Pelotas, Porto Alegre, Santa Cruz do Sul, Santa Maria, and Uruguaiana to estimate the population prevalence of COVID-19. The study was designed to be representative of the urban population of these municipalities. A questionnaire including three questions about social distancing was also administered to the participants. Here, we present descriptive analyses of social distancing practices by subgroups and use chi-square tests for comparisons. RESULTS: In terms of degree of social distancing, 25.8% of the interviewees reported being essentially isolated and 41.1% reported being quite isolated. 20.1% of respondents reported staying at home all the time, while 44.5% left only for essential activities. More than half of households reported receiving no visits from non-residents. Adults aged 20 to 59 reported the least social distancing, while more than 80% of participants aged 60 years or older reported being essentially isolated or quite isolated. Women reported more stringent distancing than men. Groups with higher educational attainment reported going out for daily activities more frequently. CONCLUSIONS: The extremes of age are more protected by social distancing, but some groups remain highly exposed. This can be an important limiting factor in controlling progression of the COVID-19 pandemic."
750,10082020083059,"Visual motion detection is one of the most important computations performed by visual circuits. Yet, we perceive vivid illusory motion in stationary, periodic luminance gradients that contain no true motion. This illusion is shared by diverse vertebrate species, but theories proposed to explain this illusion have remained difficult to test. Here, we demonstrate that in the fruit fly Drosophila, the illusory motion percept is generated by unbalanced contributions of direction-selective neurons' responses to stationary edges. First, we found that flies, like humans, perceive sustained motion in the stationary gradients. The percept was abolished when the elementary motion detector neurons T4 and T5 were silenced. In vivo calcium imaging revealed that T4 and T5 neurons encode the location and polarity of stationary edges. Furthermore, our proposed mechanistic model allowed us to predictably manipulate both the magnitude and direction of the fly's illusory percept by selectively silencing either T4 or T5 neurons. Interestingly, human brains possess the same mechanistic ingredients that drive our model in flies. When we adapted human observers to moving light edges or dark edges, we could manipulate the magnitude and direction of their percepts as well, suggesting that mechanisms similar to the fly's may also underlie this illusion in humans. By taking a comparative approach that exploits Drosophila neurogenetics, our results provide a causal, mechanistic account for a long-known visual illusion. These results argue that this illusion arises from architectures for motion detection that are shared across phyla."

752,10152021038350,"Mounting evidence from scientific community seems to suggest that COVID-19 virus can potentially spread by airborne transmission. As a result, methods and techniques for preventing environmental contagious, such as ventilation or air filtration have been proposed. Here, it is investigated the effect of moisturization on airborne COVID-19 transmission from a mechanical point of view in which comparatively large water droplets promote the growth -by collision and coalescence, of suspended airborne COVID-19 and then accelerating its gravitational settling. Utilizing a classical raindrop collisional model from cloud science and the available experimental data an expression for the removal time of suspended airborne COVID-19 as function of the relative humidity was derived. The mechanical model is in good agreement with the recent reported experimental research in which high temperature and high relative humidity reduce COVID-19 contagious and then is a point in favor of the mechanic model of the effect of moisture in the COVID-19 airborne transmission. The results encourage further research on the deliberate moisturization of room air (by using ceiling mounted humidifiers) as a potential technique for control of airborne COVID-19 transmission."
753,10062020064854,"Accumulating evidence demonstrates the decisive role of the gut microbiota in determining the effectiveness of anticancer therapeutics such as immunogenic chemotherapy or immune checkpoint blockade in preclinical tumor models, as well as in cancer patients. In synthesis, it appears that a normal intestinal microbiota supports therapeutic anticancer responses, while a dysbiotic microbiota that lacks immunostimulatory bacteria or contains overabundant immunosuppressive species causes treatment failure. These findings have led to the design of clinical trials that evaluate the capacity of modulation of the gut microbiota to synergize with treatment and hence limit tumor progression. Along the lines of this Trial Watch, we discuss the rationale for harnessing the gut microbiome in support of cancer therapy and the progress of recent clinical trials testing this new therapeutic paradigm in cancer patients."

755,10052020052844,We show the directional dichroism in a collinear antiferromagnet MnTiO_{3}. The dichroism between two distinctive antiferromagnetic states with opposite signs of staggered magnetic moments can be regarded as magnetochiral dichroism in the absence of external fields. Electric-field reversal of antiferromagnetic domain causes a change in the absorption intensity of unpolarized light around 2.15 eV. The difference in optical absorption between two antiferromagnetic states is reversed for the light propagating in the opposite direction. The absorption coefficient displays a hysteretic behavior for a cycle of sweeping the external electric or magnetic field.

757,10142021024978,"COVID-19 has reinforced the need to revisit the integration of health within disaster risk reduction (DRR) strategies for biological hazards in a system-wide approach. In November 2020, DRR experts attended the Asia-Pacific Partnership for Disaster Risk Reduction (APP-DRR) Forum to share progress and learnings in the areas of health system resilience, data management, residual risk management, risk communication, digital literacy, and knowledge product marketing. Advancements for health in DRR included the importance of multi-sectoral, multi-hazard action plans; adaptation to technological advancements in data collection, dissemination and protection; promoting the health and wellbeing of essential and nonprofessional workers; and improving inclusivity in digital literacy. COVID-19 has affected progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and created a unique opportunity within DRR to re-evaluate the adequacy of response mechanisms against concurrent, cascading or interacting risks of future biological hazards. Health emergency disaster risk management (Health-EDRM) is a new World Health Organization paradigm that includes DRR at intra-, inter- and multidisciplinary levels. Scientific advancement under Health-EDRM is necessary for health and non-health actors in DRR education and research. Continuous education on the multifaceted risk governance is a key to building awareness, capacity and accelerating towards achieving the international DRR and the SDG targets."
758,101020201010487,"There are currently around 200 SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccines in preclinical and clinical trials throughout the world. The various candidates employ a range of vaccine strategies including some novel approaches. Currently, the goal is to prove that they are safe and immunogenic in humans (phase 1/2 studies) with several now advancing into phase 2 and 3 trials to demonstrate efficacy and gather comprehensive data on safety. It is highly likely that many vaccines will be shown to stimulate antibody and T cell responses in healthy individuals and have an acceptable safety profile, but the key will be to confirm that they protect against COVID-19. There is much hope that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will be rolled out to the entire world to contain the pandemic and avert its most damaging impacts. However, in all likelihood this will initially require a targeted approach toward key vulnerable groups. Collaborative efforts are underway to ensure manufacturing can occur at the unprecedented scale and speed required to immunize billions of people. Ensuring deployment also occurs equitably across the globe will be critical. Careful evaluation and ongoing surveillance for safety will be required to address theoretical concerns regarding immune enhancement seen in previous contexts. Herein, we review the current knowledge about the immune response to this novel virus as it pertains to the design of effective and safe SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and the range of novel and established approaches to vaccine development being taken. We provide details of some of the frontrunner vaccines and discuss potential issues including adverse effects, scale-up and delivery."
759,10032020030167,"Since 2014, novel non-GII.4 norovirus (NoV) genotypes continue to be reported as the main cause of outbreaks worldwide. In this study, we analyzed the epidemiological and genetic features of NoV outbreaks from July 2014 to June 2018 in Huzhou, China. A total of 450 stool samples collected from 51 AGE outbreaks were tested for NoVs by real-time RT PCR. Partial polymerase and capsid sequences of NoV-positive samples were amplified and sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. NoVs were found to be responsible of 84.3% of AGE outbreaks in Huzhou over the past 5 years. Most NoV outbreaks were reported in the cool months (November-March) and occurred in primary schools and kindergartens. Changes in the diversity of genotypes and the distribution of predominant types were observed in recent years. At least eight genotypes were identified, and 91.9% of the genotyped outbreaks were caused by non-GII.4 strains. The top three circulating genotypes during the study period were GII.2[P16], GII.3[P12], and GII.17[P17]. The predominant NoV genotypes in outbreaks have changed from GII.4 variants to GII.17[P17] in 2014-2015, GII.3[P12] in 2015-2016, and then GII.2[P16] in 2016-2018. Non-GII.4 NoVs play an increasingly important role in outbreaks in Huzhou. Continuous surveillance is needed to monitor the emergence of novel NoV strains and help control NoV outbreaks in the next epidemic season."

Analyses of the model were carried out to determine the dynamics. The results of the analyses reveal that, using the data from China, implementing all possible control measures best reduced the rate of secondary infections. However, quarantine (isolation) of infectious individuals is shown to have the most dominant effect. This possibility emphasizes the need for extensive testing due to the possible prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases."

This study aimed to assess whether patients undergoing orthopaedic operations were being consented for the risk of contacting COVID-19 and ITU care. All orthopaedic consent forms from four-week periods in March, June and July were reviewed. Measures such as staff education were implemented after the second cycle. Of consent forms for 37 operations performed in March, only 1 mentioned the risk of contracting COVID-19 and zero mentioned ITU. During June, 89 consent forms were reviewed, 32 mentioned COVID-19 and 10 discussed ITU admission. Following educational measures, the third cycle showed a significant improvement as of 100 consent form records available for review, 73 included risk of COVID-19 whilst 26 mentioned ITU. The results show that earlier in the pandemic, surgeons at our centre were not counselling patients regarding COVID-19. This improved slightly between the first and second cycles, likely reflecting increased awareness of the nosocomial transmission of COVID-19. Educational measures contributed to a significant improvement in the third cycle. Planned interventions include use of electronic consent forms which incorporate COVID-19 infection and associated risks."
763,10132021013915,"BACKGROUND During the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak our blood bank developed protocols to guarantee accurate blood components to COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVES To provide convalescent whole blood donor screening strategies for patients recovering from COVID-19. METHODS We recruited COVID-19 recovering patients who met our defined inclusion criteria for whole blood donation. All blood units were screened for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and SARS-COV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against the S1 domain. RESULTS We screened 180 blood units from patients recovering from COVID-19. All results were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and 87.2% were positive for SARS-COV-2 IgG antibodies in the plasma. CONCLUSIONS Blood component units from recovering COVID-19 patients are safe. Plasma units with positive IgG antibodies could serve as an efficient passive immunization for COVID-19 patients. Moreover, in the face of increased transfusion demand for treatment of anemia and coagulation dysfunction in critical ill COVID-19 patients, red blood cells units and random platelets units from convalescent donors can be safely transfused."
764,10072020079162,"Abstract Pandemic COVID-19 has put unprecedented pressure on NHS providers to offer non face-to-face consultation. This study aims to assess acceptability of patients and clinicians towards teleconsultation in oral and maxillofacial surgery compared with an expected face-to-face assessment. 340 telephone clinic patient episodes were surveyed over the initial 7-week period of pandemic-related service restriction. Appointment outcomes from a further 420 telephone consultations were additionally scrutinised. 59.1% of patients expressed a strong preference for teleconsultation with only 13.1% stating a moderate or strong preference for face-to-face assessment. Diagnostic accuracy was highlighted as a concern for both clinicians and patients due to inherent inability to conduct a traditional clinical examination, notable in 43.5% of qualitative comments. Logistical concerns, communications needs and other individual circumstances formed the other emerging themes. The majority of remote consultations (59.5%) were outcomed as requiring further review. 29.3% of patients were discharged. These findings suggest that the increasing use of remote follow-up in carefully selected subgroups can facilitate efficient and acceptable healthcare delivery. Although ‘in-person’ clinical appointments will continue to be regarded as the default safe and gold standard management modality, OMFS departments should consider significant upscaling of teleconsultation services."
765,10102020108572,"The rapid growth rate of COVID-19 continues to threaten to overwhelm healthcare systems in multiple countries. In response, severely affected countries have had to impose a range of public health strategies achieved via nonpharmaceutical interventions. Broadly, these strategies have fallen into two categories: 1) “mitigation,” which aims to achieve herd immunity by allowing the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus to spread through the population while mitigating disease burden, and 2) “suppression,” aiming to drastically reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates and halt endogenous transmission in the target population. Using an age-structured transmission model, parameterized to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the United Kingdom, we assessed the long-term prospects of success using both of these approaches. We simulated a range of different nonpharmaceutical intervention scenarios incorporating social distancing applied to differing age groups. Our modeling confirmed that suppression of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is possible with plausible levels of social distancing over a period of months, consistent with observed trends. Notably, our modeling did not support achieving herd immunity as a practical objective, requiring an unlikely balancing of multiple poorly defined forces. Specifically, we found that 1) social distancing must initially reduce the transmission rate to within a narrow range, 2) to compensate for susceptible depletion, the extent of social distancing must be adaptive over time in a precise yet unfeasible way, and 3) social distancing must be maintained for an extended period to ensure the healthcare system is not overwhelmed."
766,101420210211997,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unpreceded changes to medical education. Medical students interested in urology and neurosurgery have reported concerns regarding COVID-19’s effects on clinical experience and the residency application process; however, the impact amongst students interested in plastic surgery is unknown. We hypothesized that students applying into plastic surgery may experience much distress as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An electronic survey was developed by 3 plastic surgery residents and 2 academic plastic surgeons and later refined by 4 fourth-year medical students. Questions focused on medical education curricular changes, perceived impact on medical education, and demographics. From April–May 2020 the survey was distributed to medical students who were interested in plastic surgery. Participants were identified through plastic surgery residency program personnel and social media platforms. RESULTS: IN TOTAL, 130 of the 140 respondents reported interest in plastic surgery careers. An estimated 67% were in their clinical years or completing research year(s) before residency applications. Of the respondents, 80% believed that the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on their medical education. Clinical-level students compared with preclinical-level students, and students applying to residency during the 2020–2021 match cycle compared with students not applying during the 2020–2021 match cycle were significantly more likely to perceive the COVID-19 pandemic as having a negative impact on their medical education (P = 0.04 and 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSION: Medical students interested in plastic surgery perceive the COVID-19 pandemic as having a negative impact on their education, likely due to a reduction in clinical exposure."
767,10042020040241,"Thrombocytopenia is commonly associated with sepsis and infections, which in turn are characterized by a profound immune reaction to the invading pathogen. Platelets are one of the cellular entities that exert considerable immune, antibacterial, and antiviral actions, and are therefore active participants in the host response. Platelets are sensitive to surrounding inflammatory stimuli and contribute to the immune response by multiple mechanisms, including endowing the endothelium with a proinflammatory phenotype, enhancing and amplifying leukocyte recruitment and inflammation, promoting the effector functions of immune cells, and ensuring an optimal adaptive immune response. During infection, pathogens and their products influence the platelet response and can even be toxic. However, platelets are able to sense and engage bacteria and viruses to assist in their removal and destruction. Platelets greatly contribute to host defense by multiple mechanisms, including forming immune complexes and aggregates, shedding their granular content, and internalizing pathogens and subsequently being marked for removal. These processes, and the nature of platelet function in general, cause the platelet to be irreversibly consumed in the execution of its duty. An exaggerated systemic inflammatory response to infection can drive platelet dysfunction, where platelets are inappropriately activated and face immunological destruction. While thrombocytopenia may arise by condition-specific mechanisms that cause an imbalance between platelet production and removal, this review evaluates a generic large-scale mechanism for platelet depletion as a repercussion of its involvement at the nexus of responses to infection."

770,101020201011799,"OBJECTIVE: Traditional Chinese medicine plays a significant role in the treatment of the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Tanreqing Capsule (TRQC) was used in the treatment of COVID-19 patients in the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center. This study aimed to investigate the clinical efficacy of TRQC in the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 82 patients who had laboratory-confirmed mild and moderate COVID-19; patients were treated with TRQC in one designated hospital. The treatment and control groups consisted of 25 and 57 cases, respectively. The treatment group was given TRQC orally three times a day, three pills each time, in addition to conventional Western medicine treatments which were also administered to the control group. The clinical efficacy indicators, such as the negative conversion time of pharyngeal swab nucleic acid, the negative conversion time of fecal nucleic acid, the duration of negative conversion of pharyngeal-fecal nucleic acid, and the improvement in the level of immune indicators such as T-cell subsets (CD3, CD4 and CD45) were monitored. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients in the treatment group, compared to the control group, had a shorter negative conversion time of fecal nucleic acid (4 vs. 9 days, P = 0.047) and a shorter interval of negative conversion of pharyngeal-fecal nucleic acid (0 vs. 2 days, P = 0.042). The level of CD3(+) T cells increased in the treatment group compared to the control group ([317.09 ± 274.39] vs. [175.02 ± 239.95] counts/μL, P = 0.030). No statistically significant differences were detected in the median improvement in levels of CD4(+) T cells (173 vs. 107 counts/μL, P = 0.208) and CD45(+) T cells (366 vs. 141 counts/μL, P = 0.117) between the treatment and control groups. CONCLUSION: Significant reductions in the negative conversion time of fecal nucleic acid and the duration of negative conversion of pharyngeal-fecal nucleic acid were identified in the treatment group as compared to the control group, illustrating the potential therapeutic benefits of using TRQC as a complement to conventional medicine in patients with mild and moderate COVID-19. The underlying mechanism may be related to the improved levels of the immune indicator CD3(+) T cells."
771,10162021046338,"The COVID-19 global pandemic has resulted in a large number of people suffering from emotional problems. However, the mechanisms by which intolerance of uncertainty (IU) affects negative emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the mediating role of pandemic-focused time and the moderating role of perceived efficacy in the association between IU and negative emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic based on the uncertainty-time-efficacy-emotion model (UTEE). 1131 participants were recruited to complete measures of COVID-19 IU, pandemic-focused time, perceived efficacy, negative emotions and demographic variables during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results showed that COVID-19 IU was significantly and positively associated with negative emotions, and this link could be mediated by pandemic-focused time. Moreover, the direct effect of COVID-19 IU on negative emotions was moderated by perceived efficacy. Specifically, the direct effect of COVID-19 IU on negative emotions was much stronger for individuals with lower levels of perceived efficacy. The current study further extended the previous integrative uncertainty tolerance model. Furthermore, the study suggested that policy makers and mental health professionals should reduce the general public’s negative emotions during the pandemic through effective interventions such as adjusting COVID-19 IU, shortening pandemic-focused time and enhancing perceived efficacy."
772,10072020076251,"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) brought with it rapid development of both molecular and serologic assays for identification of COVID-19 infections. While Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorization (EUA) is required for clinical application of SARS-CoV-2 molecular tests, submission for EUA is currently a voluntary process for manufacturers of serologic assays. The absence of FDA oversight of serologic tests is concerning given that the commercially available serologic assays are highly variable, differing in their format, the antibody class detected, the targeted antigen, and the acceptable specimen types. An added complication is the lack of a clear understanding for how such assays should be utilized and what the reported results ultimately indicate or, perhaps more importantly, what they do not indicate. Here, we provide a brief summary of the performance of a number of serologic assays reported in the literature, comment on what we do and do not know regarding our immune response to SARS-CoV-2, and provide a number of scenarios for which serologic testing will play a role during our global response to this pandemic."
773,100520200511135,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic general medical complications have received the most attention, whereas only few studies address the potential direct effect on mental health of SARS-CoV-2 and the neurotropic potential. Furthermore, the indirect effects of the pandemic on general mental health are of increasing concern, particularly since the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic (2002-2003) was associated with psychiatric complications. METHODS: We systematically searched the database Pubmed including studies measuring psychiatric symptoms or morbidities associated with COVID-19 among infected patients and among none infected groups the latter divided in psychiatric patients, health care workers and non-health care workers. RESULTS: A total of 43 studies were included. Out of these, only two studies evaluated patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, whereas 41 evaluated the indirect effect of the pandemic (2 on patients with preexisting psychiatric disorders, 20 on medical health care workers, and 19 on the general public). 18 of the studies were case-control studies/compared to norm, while 25 of the studies had no control groups. The two studies investigating COVID-19 patients found a high level of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) (96.2%) and significantly higher level of depressive symptoms (p=0.016). Patients with preexisting psychiatric disorders reported worsening of psychiatric symptoms. Studies investigating health care workers found increased depression/depressive symptoms, anxiety, psychological distress and poor sleep quality. Studies of the general public revealed lower psychological well-being and higher scores of anxiety and depression compared to before COVID-19, while no difference when comparing these symptoms in the initial phase of the outbreak to four weeks later. A variety of factors were associated with higher risk of psychiatric symptoms and/or low psychological well-being including female gender, poor-self-related health and relatives with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Research evaluating the direct neuropsychiatric consequences and the indirect effects on mental health is highly needed to improve treatment, mental health care planning and for preventive measures during potential subsequent pandemics."

775,10122020125825,"Following emergence in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 rapidly became pandemic and is presently responsible for millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. There is currently no approved vaccine to halt the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and only very few treatment options are available to manage COVID-19 patients. For development of preclinical countermeasures, reliable and well-characterized small animal disease models will be of paramount importance. Here we show that intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 into Syrian hamsters consistently caused moderate broncho-interstitial pneumonia, with high viral lung loads and extensive virus shedding, but animals only displayed transient mild disease. We determined the infectious dose 50 to be only five infectious particles, making the Syrian hamster a highly susceptible model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Neither hamster age nor sex had any impact on the severity of disease or course of infection. Finally, prolonged viral persistence in interleukin 2 receptor gamma chain knockout hamsters revealed susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to adaptive immune control. In conclusion, the Syrian hamster is highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 making it a very suitable infection model for COVID-19 countermeasure development."
776,10152021031412,"The prevalence of acute respiratory infections and their impact on quality of life underlies the need for efficacious solutions that are safe, sustainable and economically viable. Polysaccharides in several (traditional) plant extracts have been shown to be immunostimulatory, and some studies suggest beneficial effects against respiratory infections. The aim of this study was to (i) identify the active polysaccharide constituents from affordable and renewable crops (bell pepper and carrot) using activity-guided fractionation, (ii) evaluate in vitro effects on innate immune responses (phagocytosis and cytokine secretion), microbiota modulation and production of short chain fatty acids, followed by (iii) the evaluation of effects of a bell pepper extract enriched for the active component in a human proof of concept study. We identified rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I) as the nutricophore responsible for the immunostimulatory activity with substantial structural and functional equivalence between bell pepper (bp) and carrot (c). The in vitro studies showed that bpRG-I and cRG-I comprise similar immune- and microbiota modulatory potential and the human study demonstrated that bpRG-I was well tolerated and enhanced innate immune responsiveness in vivo. This is an important step towards testing the efficacy of RG-I from bpRG-I or cRG-I in an infection trial in humans."
777,101320210112000,"With the recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approval and rollout of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, it is important for radiologists to consider recent COVID-19 vaccination history as a possible differential diagnosis for patients with unilateral axillary adenopathy. Hyperplastic axillary nodes can be seen on sonography after any vaccination but are more common after a vaccine that evokes a strong immune response, such as the COVID-19 vaccine. As the differential of unilateral axillary adenopathy includes breast malignancy, it is crucial to both thoroughly evaluate the breast for primary malignancy and to elicit history of recent vaccination. As COVID-19 vaccines will soon be available to a larger patient population, radiologists should be familiar with the imaging features of COVID-19 vaccine induced hyperplastic adenopathy and its inclusion in a differential for unilateral axillary adenopathy. Short-term follow-up for unilateral axillary adenopathy in the setting of recent COVID-19 vaccination is an appropriate recommendation, in lieu of immediately performing potentially unnecessary and costly axillary lymph node biopsies."

Aside from the commonly used six minutes walking test (6MWT), four meter gait speed (4MGS) are widely used for its practicality. This study aimed to assess the agreement between 4 MGS and the 6MWT in Indonesian healthy adults. Methods This agreement analysis study had recruited 61 healthy and sedentary Indonesians aged 18 until 50 years old, and they were instructed to perform three tests, namely 6MWT and 4MGS with six meters and eight meters track. These gait speed were then compared to assess validity. Results Mean gait speed results for males in 6MWT is 1.602 m/s, whereas 4MGS in six meter track is 2.114 m/s and similarly 2.108 m/s in the eight meter track. Females on the other hand, achieved 1.462 m/s for 6MWT, 1.908 m/s and 1.986 m/s for 4MGS in six and eight meter simultaneously. Bland Altman Agreement test between the 6MWT and 4MGS shows scatter dots with close limit of agreement, thus showing a good agreement between the 6MWT and 4 MGS with both tracks. Discussion Both track length of 4 MGS were in a good agreement with 6MWT for functional capacity assessment. Conclusions In response to the COVID-19 pandemic era, shorter track of 4MGS (six meters) can be feasibly utilized. It is evident that shorter duration and track will boost the tests practicality in assessing functional capacity for both inpatient and outpatient settings."

780,101520210311367,"Conditional particle filters (CPFs) are powerful smoothing algorithms for general nonlinear/non-Gaussian hidden Markov models. However, CPFs can be inefficient or difficult to apply with diffuse initial distributions, which are common in statistical applications. We propose a simple but generally applicable auxiliary variable method, which can be used together with the CPF in order to perform efficient inference with diffuse initial distributions. The method only requires simulatable Markov transitions that are reversible with respect to the initial distribution, which can be improper. We focus in particular on random walk type transitions which are reversible with respect to a uniform initial distribution (on some domain), and autoregressive kernels for Gaussian initial distributions. We propose to use online adaptations within the methods. In the case of random walk transition, our adaptations use the estimated covariance and acceptance rate adaptation, and we detail their theoretical validity. We tested our methods with a linear Gaussian random walk model, a stochastic volatility model, and a stochastic epidemic compartment model with time-varying transmission rate. The experimental findings demonstrate that our method works reliably with little user specification and can be substantially better mixing than a direct particle Gibbs algorithm that treats initial states as parameters.

These psychometric instruments can be easily adapted to an online setting by means of electronic forms. However, this approach lacks the interacting and engaging features of modern digital environments. With the aim of making depression screening more available, attractive and effective, we developed Perla, a conversational agent able to perform an interview based on the PHQ-9. We also conducted a validation study in which we compared the results obtained by the traditional self-report questionnaire with Perla's automated interview. Analyzing the results from this study we draw two significant conclusions: firstly, Perla is much preferred by Internet users, achieving more than 2.5 times more reach than a traditional form-based questionnaire; secondly, her psychometric properties (Cronbach's {\alpha} of 0.81, sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 90%) are excellent and comparable to the traditional well-established depression screening questionnaires."
782,10082020086121,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19) has spread worldwide, and it has reached to more than 14.5 million cases. Although Hubei province is the epicenter of China, little is known about epidemiological and clinical features of COVID‐19 in other areas in Hubei province around Wuhan. In addition, the virological data, particularly the factors associated with viral shedding of COVID‐19 has not been well described. OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiological and clinical features of patients with COVID‐19 in Tianmen city, and identify risk factors associated with prolonged viral shedding of COVID‐19. METHODS: Inpatients with COVID‐19 admitted before February 9, 2020 were included. Characteristics were compared between patients with early and late viral RNA shedding. Multivariate cox regression model was used to investigate variables associated with prolonged viral shedding. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty‐three patients were included. About 8.2% patients were categorized as critical degree of severity. All patients received antiviral therapy, with arbidol and interferon being the commonest. About 38.3% and 16.9% patients were treated with corticosteroid and immunoglobulin, respectively. Time from onset to admission (HR = 0.829, P < 0.001), and administration of corticosteroid (HR = 0.496, P = 0.002), arbidol (HR = 2.605, P = 0.008) and oseltamivir (HR = 0.416, P < 0.001) were independently associated with duration of viral shedding. CONCLUSION: Symptoms of patients from Tianmen are relatively mild. Treatment should be started as early as possible, but corticosteroid and oseltamivir should be initiated with caution. In addition, clinical trials on arbidol should be conducted to demonstrate its effectiveness."
783,10062020067385,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Many of the statutes comprising the shelter-in-place and phased-reopening orders are centered around minimizing asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission. Assumptions about the presence and relative importance of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission are based on case reports, the failing of quarantine measures aimed at sequestering ill patients, viral dynamic studies suggesting SARS-CoV-2 production peaks before symptoms appear, and modeling evidence that calculates serial interval between successive generations of infection. In aggregate, these data offer compelling evidence of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission, but individually these studies have notable shortcomings that undermine their conclusions. The purpose of this review is to discuss the literature of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission, highlight limitations of recent studies, and propose experiments that, if conducted, would provide a more definitive analysis of the relative role of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission in the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of literature on PubMed using search filters that relate to asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission as well as serial interval and viral dynamics. We focused on studies that provided primary clinical data. RESULTS: 34 studies were eligible for inclusion in this systematic review: 11 case reports pertaining to asymptomatic transmission, 9 viral kinetic studies, 13 serial interval studies, and 1 study with viral kinetics and serial interval. CONCLUSION: Different approaches to determining the presence and prevalence of asymptomatic and presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 transmission have notable shortcomings, which were highlighted in this review and limit our ability to draw definitive conclusions. Conducting high quality studies with the aim of understanding the relative role of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission is instrumental to developing the most informed policies on reopening our cities, states, and countries."

Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) superinfection has been reported in case series of critically ill patients. Mexico has been widely affected by SARS-CoV-2. We present a case series of COVID-19-associated IPA at a teaching hospital in Mexico City. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of COVID-19 patients admitted to the ABC Medical Center from March 13 to June 1, 2020. Only those with severe or critical COVID-19 were hospitalized. Patients with a diagnosis of putative IPA were analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 was diagnosed by Real-Time PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs. Aspergillus antigen testing in tracheal aspirate and serum was done with Aspergillus-specific galactomannoprotein (GP) ELISA (Euroimmun Medizinische Labordiagnostika).The study was approved by the hospital ethics committee. RESULTS: Among the 47 admitted patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), we identified seven (14.9%) cases of IPA. The mean age was 59.7 ± 17.8 years and five were male. All our patients had comorbidities, but none were under previous immunosuppressive treatment. All had critical COVID-19 pneumonia requiring IMV. All but one patient received corticosteroids, and five patients were treated with tocilizumab before IPA diagnosis. Putative IPA was diagnosed in six cases (86%) by a positive GP in tracheal aspirate, additionally in one of these, the tracheal aspirate culture also grew Aspergillus niger. The remaining one (14%) had a positive serum GP. The median time from COVID-19 to IPA diagnosis was 10 days. There were five bacterial co-infections, three with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one with Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and one with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Six patients were treated with isavuconazole and one voriconazole. As of June 17, 2020, three patients had died, two patients had been discharged, and two were still in the intensive care unit receiving IMV. Aspergillus niger isolated from a tracheal aspirate of a critically-ill COVID-19 patient [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: COVID-19-associated IPA had a lower prevalence than previously reported in other series.

786,10052020051395,"Helicopters and tiltrotor aircrafts are known to fall into an unstable state called vortex ring state when they descend rapidly. This paper presents a six degrees of freedom descending flight simulation of a tiltrotor aircraft represented by the V-22 Osprey, considering the interaction between fluid and a rigid body. That is, an aircraft affects the surrounding flow field by rotating the rotors, and flies with the generated force as thrust. Similarly, an orientation of the airframe is controlled by aerodynamic force which is generated by manipulating the shape. This numerical analysis is a complicated moving boundary problem involving motion of an air-frame or rotation of rotors. As a numerical approach, the Moving Computational Domain (MCD) method in combination with the multi-axis sliding mesh approach is adopted. In the MCD method, the whole computational domain moves with objects in the domain. At this time, fluid flow around the objects is generated by the movement of the boundaries. In addition, this method removes computational space restrictions, allowing an aircraft to move freely within the computational space regardless of a size of a computational grid. The multi-axis sliding mesh approach allows rotating bodies to be placed in a computational grid. Using the above approach, the flight simulation at two different descent rates is performed to reveal a behavior of a tiltrotor aircraft and a state of the surrounding flow field."

Frequency distribution, Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used in this study. Results: Out of 305 participants, 224 (73.4%) and 81 (26.6%) were male and female students respectively. The study revealed that Rajshahi university students had average knowledge on symptoms, protective way and transmission of COVID-19. Female students were more knowledgeable than male. More than one third of the students had negative attitude to avoiding public transport and going out to public places with friends and family. The practice of students during our data collection period and in future was not satisfactory. More than one third of students were not keen to stay at home and avoid going to crowded places. The perception towards COVID-19 was not good; they had no idea whether the outbreak would affect their daily routine, study and financial matters, study field work and restrict leisure time of meeting family and relatives. Conclusions: We found that general knowledge, attitude, practice and perception of the university students regarding COVID-19 were not satisfactory. This indicated that the situation was worse among common people. In Bangladesh, the number of healthcare providers is insufficient. University students can be employed as potential workforce to create awareness among mass people on prevention of COVID-19."
789,10072020072037,"BACKGROUND Following bariatric surgery, an explicit dietary regimen is required to facilitate and maintain successful weight loss. Without adequate access to healthy foods, weight maintenance can be hindered. OBJECTIVE Examine influence degree of food access has on Appalachian bariatric surgery patient weight loss outcomes. SETTING Appalachian University hospital, United States. METHODS A retrospective chart review was used to examine the influence of food accessibility on weight loss outcomes in an Appalachian bariatric surgery patient population at a large tertiary hospital in West Virginia between 2013 and 2017. Demographic characteristics, health and family history, and 1-year surgery outcomes were collected. A state-specific food accessibility score was calculated for each patient address using the geographic information system. Patients were assigned a food access ranking score (FARS) between 0 (low food access) and 4 (high food access) based on criteria of quantity, quality, income, and vehicle access. RESULTS Patients (n = 369) were predominately married (60.5%), white (92.4%), female (77.8%), and underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (75.9%), with a mean age of 45 years. Most patients had low FARS (M = 1.67 ± .73; 72.6%). Nonwhite patients (P = .03) with a preoperative diagnosis of depression (P = .02) or without a family history of obesity (P = .01) were found to be in the lower FARS categories. FARS was not indicative of weight loss post surgery (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS Food accessibility in West Virginia was not associated with bariatric surgery weight outcomes at 1-year post operation. Lower food access was associated with nonwhite race/ethnicity, diagnosed depression at baseline, and no family history of obesity. Future studies should include more extended follow-up data collection and mixed-method approaches to capture perceptions of food access and its impact on the patients' postoperative journey."
790,10142021021800,"BACKGROUND Intrathecal analgesia (IA) has been recommended by the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Society for laparoscopic colon resections; however, although IA is used in open liver resections, it has not been extensively studied in laparoscopic hepatobiliary surgery. This retrospective chart review was undertaken to explore postoperative pain within 48 hours among patients who underwent laparoscopic liver resections (LLR), receiving either IA with or without patient-controlled analgesia (IA±PCA) versus PCA alone. METHODS After ethics approval, charts were reviewed for adult patients who underwent LLR between January 2016 and April 2019, and had IA±PCA or PCA alone. Patients with any contraindication to IA with morphine, obstructive sleep apnea, body mass index >40 kg/m2, history of chronic pain, and/or history of drug use were excluded. Descriptive statistics used to describe postoperative pain levels at 48 hours by treatment group for each pain outcome. RESULTS Of 111 patients identified, 79 patients were finally included; 22 patients had IA±PCA and 57 patients had PCA only. There were no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics, use of non-opioid pain control, and postoperative complications between the two groups. IA use was associated with reduced postoperative opioid consumption (measured in oral morphine equivalents) compared to PCA alone (mean difference [95% confidence interval] -45.92 [-83.10 to -8.75]; p=0.016). CONCLUSIONS IA has the potential to decrease postoperative opioid use for patients undergoing LLR, and appears to be safe and effective in the setting of LLR. These findings are consistent with the ERAS Society recommendations for laparoscopic colorectal surgery."
791,10132021018840,"BACKGROUND: The literature shows the negative psychological impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak on frontline healthcare workers. However, few are known about the mental health of physicians and nurses working in general hospitals during the outbreak, caring for patients with COVID-19 or not. OBJECTIVES: This survey assessed differences in mental health in physicians and nurses working in COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 medical care units. DESIGN: A cross-sectional mixed-mode survey was used to assess burnout, insomnia, depression, anxiety, and stress. SETTING: A total of 1,244 physicians and nurses from five general hospitals in Belgium, working in COVID-19 care units (CCU), non-COVID-19 care units (NCCU), or both (CCU + NCCU) were informed of the study. PARTICIPANTS: Six hundred forty-seven healthcare workers participated in the survey (response rate = 52%). MEASUREMENTS: Validated instruments were used to assess the outcomes: the PFI (burnout/professional fulfillment), the ISI (insomnia), and the DASS-21 (depression, anxiety, and stress). RESULTS: Results showed high prevalence of burnout, insomnia, depression, and anxiety among participants. After adjusting for confounders, multivariate analysis of variance showed no differences between CCU, NCCU, and CCU + NCCU workers. Univariate general linear models showed higher level of burnout, insomnia, and anxiety among nurses in comparison to physicians. Being a nurse, young, isolated, with an increased workload were risk factors for worse mental health outcomes. LIMITATIONS: The mental health of the tested sample, before the outbreak, is unknown. Moreover, this cross-sectional design provides no information on the evolution of the mental health outcomes over time. CONCLUSION: Directly caring for patients with COVID-19 is not associated with worse mental health outcomes among healthcare workers in general hospitals. High prevalence of burnout, insomnia, depression, and anxiety among physicians and nurses requires special attention, and specific interventions need to be implemented.

792,100920200912957,"INTRODUCTION: Pelvic floor myalgia is a common cause and contributor to chronic pelvic pain [Neurourol Urodyn 4:984–1008 (2017)]. The purpose of this study was to compare in-person versus video-based teaching methods of a comprehensive assessment of the pelvic floor musculature on a pelvic model. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial of 46 participants was conducted. The participants were randomized into two groups. Both groups were taught by the same pelvic floor physiotherapist using two different teaching methods on a pelvic model. Group 1 watched an instructional video, whereas group 2 had in-person training. Both groups underwent pre- and post-training assessments consisting of a written examination and an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). Primary outcome measure was the change in participants’ pre- and post-training assessment scores. Secondary outcome measures were perceived changes in both participants’ comfort level in performing pelvic floor examination and applicability of the training program to clinical practice. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the teaching methods in the degree of improvement of the participants’ mean written assessment scores (p = 0.58), OSCE scores (p = 0.15), and perceived comfort level (p = 0.19). Participants’ mean pre- and post-assessment scores improved significantly (p < 0.001). Participants reported the training program to be applicable towards their clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that learners’ assessment of pelvic floor musculature can be enhanced using varied teaching methods on a pelvic model."
793,10082020089212,"BACKGROUND: Our hospital experienced the first healthcare-associated COVID-19 outbreak in Seoul at the time the first COVID-19 cases were confirmed in Korea. The first confirmed COVID-19 patient was a hospital personnel who was in charge of transferring patients inside our hospital. To contain the virus spread, we shutdown our hospital, and tested all inpatients, medical staff members, and employees. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the results of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing according to the contact history, occupation, and presence of respiratory symptoms. Closed-circuit television (CCTV) was reviewed in the presence of an epidemiologist to identify individuals who came into contact with confirmed COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: A total of 3,091 respiratory samples from 2,924 individuals were obtained. Among 2,924 individuals, two inpatients, and one caregiver tested positive (positivity rate, 0.1%). Although all confirmed cases were linked to a general ward designated for pulmonology patients, no medical staff members, medical support personnel, or employees working at the same ward were infected. Contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases was frequent among inpatients and medical support personnel. The most common contact area was the general ward for pulmonology patients and medical support areas, including clinical and imaging examination rooms. Finally, the total number of hospital-associated infections was 14, consisting of four diagnosed at our hospital and ten diagnosed outside the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: The robust control of the COVID-19 outbreak further minimized the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital and local communities. However, there was also a debate over the appropriate period of hospital shutdown and testing of all hospital staff and patients. Future studies are required to refine and establish the in-hospital quarantine and de-isolation guidelines based on the epidemiological and clinical settings."
794,101320210111509,"INTRODUCTION: The Covid-19 pandemic affects maternal health both directly and indirectly, and direct and indirect effects are intertwined. To provide a comprehensive overview on this broad topic in a rapid format behooving an emergent pandemic we conducted a scoping review. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted to compile evidence on direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic on maternal health and provide an overview of the most significant outcomes thus far. Working papers and news articles were considered appropriate evidence along with peer-reviewed publications in order to capture rapidly evolving updates. Literature in English published from January 1st to September 11 2020 was included if it pertained to the direct or indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical, mental, economic, or social health and wellbeing of pregnant people. Narrative descriptions were written about subject areas for which the authors found the most evidence. RESULTS: The search yielded 396 publications, of which 95 were included. Pregnant individuals were found to be at a heightened risk of more severe symptoms than people who are not pregnant. Intrauterine, vertical, and breastmilk transmission were unlikely. Labor, delivery, and breastfeeding guidelines for COVID-19 positive patients varied. Severe increases in maternal mental health issues, such as clinically relevant anxiety and depression, were reported. Domestic violence appeared to spike. Prenatal care visits decreased, healthcare infrastructure was strained, and potentially harmful policies implemented with little evidence. Women were more likely to lose their income due to the pandemic than men, and working mothers struggled with increased childcare demands. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women and mothers were not found to be at higher risk for COVID-19 infection than people who are not pregnant, however pregnant people with symptomatic COVID-19 may experience more adverse outcomes compared to non-pregnant people and seem to face disproportionate adverse socio-economic consequences. High income and low- and middle-income countries alike faced significant struggles. Further resources should be directed towards quality epidemiological studies. PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY: The Covid-19 pandemic impacts reproductive and perinatal health both directly through infection itself but also indirectly as a consequence of changes in health care, social policy, or social and economic circumstances. The direct and indirect consequences of COVID-19 on maternal health are intertwined. To provide a comprehensive overview on this broad topic we conducted a scoping review. Pregnant women who have symptomatic COVID-19 may experience more severe outcomes than people who are not pregnant. Intrauterine and breastmilk transmission, and the passage of the virus from mother to baby during delivery are unlikely. The guidelines for labor, delivery, and breastfeeding for COVID-19 positive patients vary, and this variability could create uncertainty and unnecessary harm. Prenatal care visits decreased, healthcare infrastructure was strained, and potentially harmful policies are implemented with little evidence in high and low/middle income countries. The social and economic impact of COVID-19 on maternal health is marked. A high frequency of maternal mental health problems, such as clinically relevant anxiety and depression, during the epidemic are reported in many countries. This likely reflects an increase in problems, but studies demonstrating a true change are lacking. Domestic violence appeared to spike. Women were more vulnerable to losing their income due to the pandemic than men, and working mothers struggled with increased childcare demands. We make several recommendations: more resources should be directed to epidemiological studies, health and social services for pregnant women and mothers should not be diminished, and more focus on maternal mental health during the epidemic is needed."
795,10172021051845,"Face recognition is a well-researched domain however many issues for instance expression changes, illumination variations, and presence of occlusion in the face images seriously affect the performance of such systems. A recent survey shows that COVID-19 will also have a considerable and long-term impact on biometric face recognition systems. The work has presented two novel Savitzky–Golay differentiator (SGD) and gradient-based Savitzky–Golay differentiator (GSGD) feature extraction techniques to elevate issues related to face recognition systems. The SGD and GSGD feature descriptors are able to extract discriminative information present in different parts of the face image. In this paper, an efficient and robust person identification using symbolic data modeling approach and similarity analysis measure is devised and employed for feature representation and classification tasks to address the aforementioned issues of face recognition. Extensive experiments and comparisons of the proposed descriptors experimental results indicated that the proposed approaches can achieve optimal performance of 96–97, 92–96, 100, 84–93, and 87–96% on LFW, ORL, AR, IJB-A datasets, and newly devised VISA database, respectively."

798,10152021035674,"Detection of nocturnal seizures in epilepsy patients is essential, both for the quick management of the seizure complications, and for the assessment of the ongoing seizure treatment. Traditional seizure detection products (e.g., wearables), however, are either very costly, uncomfortable, or unreliable. In this paper, we then propose to utilize everyday WiFi signals for robust, fast, and non-invasive detection of nocturnal seizures. We first present a new and rigorous mathematical characterization for the spectral content/bandwidth of the WiFi signal, measured on a WiFi device placed near a sleeping patient, during different kinds of sleep motions: seizures, normal movements (e.g. posture adjustments), and breathing. Based on this mathematical modeling, we propose a novel pipeline for processing the received WiFi signals to robustly detect all nocturnal non-breathing movements, and then classify them into normal body movements or seizures. In order to validate this, we carry out extensive experiments in 7 different typical bedroom locations, where a set of 20 actors simulate the state of having seizures (total of 260 instances), as well as normal sleep movements (total of 410 instances). Our proposed system detects 93.85% of the seizures with a mean response time of only 5.69 seconds since the onset of the seizure. Moreover, our proposed system achieves a probability of false alarm of only 0.0097, when classifying normal sleep movements. Overall, our new mathematical modeling and experimental results show the great potential the ubiquitous WiFi signals have for detecting nocturnal seizures, which can provide better support for epilepsy patients and their caregivers."

800,10162021045631,"BACKGROUND: A wide range of mortality rates has been reported in COVID-19 patients on the intensive care unit. We wanted to describe the clinical course and determine the mortality rate in our institution’s intensive care units. METHODS: To this end, we performed a retrospective cohort study of 50 COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU at a large German tertiary university hospital. Clinical features are reported with a focus on ICU interventions, such as mechanical ventilation, prone positioning and extracorporeal organ support. Outcome is presented using a 7-point ordinal scale on day 28 and 60 following ICU admission. RESULTS: The median age was 64 years, 78% were male. LDH and D-Dimers were elevated, and patients were low on Vitamin D. ARDS incidence was 75%, and 43/50 patients needed invasive ventilation. 22/50 patients intermittently needed prone positioning, and 7/50 required ECMO. The interval from onset of the first symptoms to admission to the hospital and to the ICU was shorter in non-survivors than in survivors. By day 60 after ICU admission, 52% of the patients had been discharged. 60-day mortality rate was 32%; 37% for ventilated patients, and 42% for those requiring both: ventilation and renal replacement therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Early deterioration might be seen as a warning signal for unfavourable outcome. Lung-protective ventilation including prone positioning remain the mainstay of the treatment."

802,100620200611448,"Data sources This review included 13 clinical studies (observational or clinical trial) which reported results of studies of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The other 62 referenced papers were of different types (eg, reviews, WHO protocols, letter to editor etc). Study selection The study selected trials, reviews, and in-vitro research assessing the critical aspects of saliva as an easily accessible and early-stage diagnostic source, and also an entry route for 2019-nCoV. Most of the clinical studies were descriptive case series of patients who had contracted 2019-nCoV in China. These were mainly studies designed to compare saliva samples with throat swabs, with regard to the presence of 2019-nCoV RNA. Another aspect of the included studies was the susceptibility of oral tissues to 2019-nCoV due to the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) as a receptor for the 2019-nCoV. Some review studies and clinical infection control protocols were also included to discuss the transmission patterns of 2019-nCoV from the oral cavity. Studies were not restricted to English language and they were not all full-text papers. Data extraction and synthesis A narrative synthesis of the results was conducted using distinct headings and subheadings, defined by the authors based on relevancy to the consensus about the importance of saliva with reference to 2019-nCoV. Results There was an inherent heterogeneity among the included clinical studies concerning their designs, sampling techniques, and the results about the diagnostic value of saliva. The percentage of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) patients with positive 2019-nCoV RNA varied from 12.9% to 91.67% among these studies. Regarding the possibility of direct virus invasion into the oral tissues, the results suggested that ACE2+ cells in salivary glands could possibly be the target cells of 2019-nCoV and theoretically could generate infectious saliva in a sustained way. Furin was suggested as another protein which makes the tongue more vulnerable to 2019-nCoV, especially in conditions inducing its upregulation (for example, squamous cell carcinoma). According to the comparisons between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, saliva could be considered of diagnostic value via the early detection of viral RNA for both of the viruses. Whilst the viral peak was shown to be at onset of symptoms for 2019-nCoV, it can linger up to the tenth day after the appearance of symptoms for SARS-CoV. Finally, this paper warns about airborne transmission, particularly for close contacts. Conclusions Saliva can be proposed as an easily accessible diagnostic source although further clinical studies are required. Given the presence of viral RNA in saliva in the early stages of COVID-19, the recommendations to wear masks to prevent the rapid transmission of infectious droplets into the air, and keep a safe distance from other people are clearly based in evidence."
803,10102020104348,"The nonparametric formulation of density-based clustering, known as modal clustering, draws a correspondence between groups and the attraction domains of the modes of the density function underlying the data. Its probabilistic foundation allows for a natural, yet not trivial, generalization of the approach to the matrix-valued setting, increasingly widespread, for example, in longitudinal and multivariate spatio-temporal studies. In this work we introduce nonparametric estimators of matrix-variate distributions based on kernel methods, and analyze their asymptotic properties. Additionally, we propose a generalization of the mean-shift procedure for the identification of the modes of the estimated density. Given the intrinsic high dimensionality of matrix-variate data, we discuss some locally adaptive solutions to handle the problem. We test the procedure via extensive simulations, also with respect to some competitors, and illustrate its performance through two high-dimensional real data applications."
804,10042020043748,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is leading to social (physical) distancing policies worldwide, including in the USA. Some of the first actions taken by governments are the closing of schools. The evidence that mandatory school closures reduce the number of cases and, ultimately, mortality comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the effect of school closure on the health-care labour force. The potential benefits from school closures need to be weighed against costs of health-care worker absenteeism associated with additional child-care obligations. In this study, we aimed to measure child-care obligations for US health-care workers arising from school closures when these are used as a social distancing measure. We then assessed how important the contribution of health-care workers would have to be in reducing mortality for their absenteeism due to child-care obligations to undo the benefits of school closures in reducing the number of cases. METHODS: For this modelling analysis, we used data from the monthly releases of the US Current Population Survey to characterise the family structure and probable within-household child-care options of US health-care workers. We accounted for the occupation within the health-care sector, state, and household structure to identify the segments of the health-care workforce that are most exposed to child-care obligations from school closures. We used these estimates to identify the critical level at which the importance of health-care labour supply in increasing the survival probability of a patient with COVID-19 would undo the benefits of school closures and ultimately increase cumulative mortality. FINDINGS: Between January, 2018, and January, 2020, the US Current Population Survey included information on more than 3·1 million individuals across 1·3 million households. We found that the US health-care sector has some of the highest child-care obligations in the USA, with 28·8% (95% CI 28·5–29·1) of the health-care workforce needing to provide care for children aged 3–12 years. Assuming non-working adults or a sibling aged 13 years or older can provide child care, 15·0% (14·8–15·2) of the health-care workforce would still be in need of child care during a school closure. We observed substantial variation within the health-care system. We estimated that, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 15·0% case reduction from school closings and 2·0% baseline mortality rate, a 15·0% decrease in the health-care labour force would need to decrease the survival probability per percent health-care worker lost by 17·6% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality. Our model estimates that if the infection mortality rate of COVID-19 increases from 2·00% to 2·35% when the health-care workforce declines by 15·0%, school closures could lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent. INTERPRETATION: School closures come with many trade-offs, and can create unintended child-care obligations. Our results suggest that the potential contagion prevention from school closures needs to be carefully weighted with the potential loss of health-care workers from the standpoint of reducing cumulative mortality due to COVID-19, in the absence of mitigating measures. FUNDING: None."
805,101520210315101,"We investigated the incidence, clinical characteristics, risk factors, and outcome of meningoencephalitis (ME) in patients with COVID-19 attending emergency departments (ED), before hospitalization. We retrospectively reviewed all COVID patients diagnosed with ME in 61 Spanish EDs (20% of Spanish EDs, COVID-ME) during the COVID pandemic. We formed two control groups: non-COVID patients with ME (non-COVID-ME) and COVID patients without ME (COVID-non-ME). Unadjusted comparisons between cases and controls were performed regarding 57 baseline and clinical characteristics and 4 outcomes. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biochemical and serologic findings of COVID-ME and non-COVID-ME were also investigated. We identified 29 ME in 71,904 patients with COVID-19 attending EDs (0.40‰, 95%CI=0.27–0.58). This incidence was higher than that observed in non-COVID patients (150/1,358,134, 0.11‰, 95%CI=0.09–0.13; OR=3.65, 95%CI=2.45–5.44). With respect to non-COVID-ME, COVID-ME more frequently had dyspnea and chest X-ray abnormalities, and neck stiffness was less frequent (OR=0.3, 95%CI=0.1–0.9). In 69.0% of COVID-ME, CSF cells were predominantly lymphocytes, and SARS-CoV-2 antigen was detected by RT-PCR in 1 patient. The clinical characteristics associated with a higher risk of presenting ME in COVID patients were vomiting (OR=3.7, 95%CI=1.4–10.2), headache (OR=24.7, 95%CI=10.2–60.1), and altered mental status (OR=12.9, 95%CI=6.6–25.0). COVID-ME patients had a higher in-hospital mortality than non-COVID-ME patients (OR=2.26; 95%CI=1.04–4.48), and a higher need for hospitalization (OR=8.02; 95%CI=1.19–66.7) and intensive care admission (OR=5.89; 95%CI=3.12–11.14) than COVID-non-ME patients. ME is an unusual form of COVID presentation (<0.5‰ cases), but is more than 4-fold more frequent than in non-COVID patients attending the ED. As the majority of these MEs had lymphocytic predominance and in one patient SARS-CoV-2 antigen was detected in CSF, SARS-CoV-2 could be the cause of most of the cases observed. COVID-ME patients had a higher unadjusted in-hospital mortality than non-COVID-ME patients."

807,10132021019586,"OBJECTIVE: The proportion of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 that are prescribed antibiotics is uncertain, and may contribute to patient harm and global antibiotic resistance. Our objective was to estimate the prevalence and associated factors of antibiotic use in patients with confirmed COVID-19. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, OVID Epub and EMBASE for published literature on human subjects in English up to June 9, 2020. Inclusion criteria were any healthcare settings and age groups; randomized controlled trials; cohort studies; case series with >10 patients; experimental or observational design that evaluated antibiotic prescribing. The main outcome of interest was proportion of COVID-19 patients prescribed an antibiotic, stratified by geographical region, severity of illness, and age. We pooled proportion data using random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: We screened 7469 studies, from which 154 were included in the final analysis. Antibiotic data were available from 30,623 patients. The prevalence of antibiotic prescribing was 74.6% (95% CI 68.3 to 80.0%). On univariable meta-regression, antibiotic prescribing was lower in children (prescribing prevalence odds ratio (OR) 0.10, 95%CI 0.03 to 0.33) compared to adults. Antibiotic prescribing was higher with increasing patient age (OR 1.45 per 10 year increase, 95%CI 1.18 to 1.77) and higher with increasing proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation (OR 1.33 per 10% increase, 95%CI 1.15 to 1.54). Estimated bacterial co-infection was 8.6% (95% CI 4.7-15.2%) from 31 studies. CONCLUSIONS: Three-quarters of patients with COVID-19 receive antibiotics, prescribing is significantly higher than the estimated prevalence of bacterial co-infection. Unnecessary antibiotic use is likely high in patients with COVID-19. REGISTRATION: PROSPERO (ID CRD42020192286)."
808,100920200913491,"Massive worldwide serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 is needed to determine the extent of virus exposure in a particular region, the ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic infected persons, and the duration and extent of immunity after infection. To achieve this aim, the development and production of reliable and cost-effective SARS-CoV-2 antigens is critical. Here, we report the bacterial production of the peptide S-RBDN318-V510, which contains the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We purified this peptide using a straightforward approach involving bacterial lysis, his-tag mediated affinity chromatography, and imidazole-assisted refolding. The antigen performances of S RBDN318 V510 and a commercial full-length spike protein were compared in two distinct ELISAs. In direct ELISAs, where the antigen was directly bound to the ELISA surface, both antigens discriminated sera from non-exposed and exposed individuals. However, the discriminating resolution was better in ELISAs that used the full-spike antigen than the S-RBDN318-V510. Attachment of the antigens to the ELISA surface using a layer of anti-histidine antibodies gave equivalent resolution for both S-RBDN318-V510 and the full length spike protein. Our results demonstrate that ELISA-functional SARS-CoV-2 antigens can be produced in bacterial cultures. S-RBDN318-V510 is amenable to massive production and may represent a cost-effective alternative to the use of structurally more complex antigens in serological COVID-19 testing."
809,10112020118960,"The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) around the world has put a heavy burden on human society and is also a great challenge facing medical staff. This study aimed to assess the difficulties faced by health care personnel (HCP) in using personal protective equipment (PPE) in clinical practice during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China. One hundred twenty medical staff from the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University presented to the Wuhan First Hospital to provide medical assistance, from whom 20 HCP volunteered to participate in a focus group discussion attended by infection control nurse leaders. Participants’ responses and discussions were recorded, and the content was analyzed for themes. Observed difficulties included inappropriate PPE sizes, the design of the PPE and its complexity of use, doubts related to the quality and effectiveness of PPE, potential risks during doffing, space layout between clean and contaminated area, and poor comfort with PPE use. Other factors, such as the support environment, management, processes, preparedness, HCP, and equipment can also have a positive or negative impact on the use of PPE. Future efforts to optimize PPE use should focus on strengthening training for HCP using real items for increasing compliance with standardized protocols, improving PPE design, and performing further research on the risks, benefits, and best practices of PPE use."
810,10042020042456,"Rapid testing of appropriate specimens from patients suspected for a disease during an epidemic, such as the current Coronavirus outbreak, is of a great importance for the disease management and control. We propose a method to enhance processing large amounts of collected samples. The method is based on mixing samples in testing tubes in a specific configuration, as opposed to testing single samples in each tube, and accounting for natural virus amounts in infected patients from variation of positiveness in test tubes. To illustrate the efficiency of the suggested method we carry out numerical tests for actual scenarios under various tests. Applying the proposed method enhances the number of tests by order of magnitudes, where all positives are identified with no false negatives, and the effective testing time can be reduced drastically even when the uncertainty in the test is relatively high."
811,10102020105056,"Hijacking and manipulation of host cell biosynthetic pathways by human enveloped viruses are essential for the viral lifecycle. Flaviviridae members, including hepatitis C, dengue and Zika viruses, extensively manipulate host lipid metabolism, underlining the importance of lipid droplets (LDs) in viral infection. LDs are dynamic cytoplasmic organelles that can act as sequestration platforms for a unique subset of host and viral proteins. Transient recruitment and mobilization of proteins to LDs during viral infection impacts host-cell biological properties, LD functionality and canonical protein functions. Notably, recent studies identified LDs in the nucleus and also identified that LDs are transported extracellularly via an autophagy-mediated mechanism, indicating a novel role for autophagy in Flaviviridae infections. These developments underline an unsuspected diversity and localization of LDs and potential moonlighting functions of LD-associated proteins during infection. This review summarizes recent breakthroughs concerning the LD hijacking activities of hepatitis C, dengue and Zika viruses and potential roles of cytoplasmic, nuclear and extracellular LD-associated viral proteins during infection."
812,100620200610756,"Abstract/Summary SARS-CoV-2 genomic and subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) transcripts hijack the host cell's machinery. Subcellular localization of its viral RNA could thus play important roles in viral replication and host antiviral immune response. We perform computational modeling of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA subcellular residency across eight subcellular neighborhoods. We compare hundreds of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to the human transcriptome and other coronaviruses. We predict the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and sgRNAs to be enriched towards the host mitochondrial matrix and nucleolus, and that the 5’ and 3’ viral untranslated regions contain the strongest, most distinct localization signals. We interpret the mitochondrial residency signal as an indicator of intracellular RNA trafficking with respect to double-membrane vesicles, a critical stage in the coronavirus life cycle. Our computational analysis serves as a hypothesis generation tool to suggest models for SARS-CoV-2 biology and inform experimental efforts to combat the virus. A record of this paper’s Transparent Peer Review process is included in the Supplemental Information."
813,10072020074446,"The novel corona-virus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a major outbreak in more than 200 countries around the world, leading to a severe impact on the health and life of many people globally. As of mid-July 2020, more than 12 million people were infected, and more than 570,000 death were reported. Computed Tomography (CT) images can be used as an alternative to the time-consuming RT-PCR test, to detect COVID-19. In this work we propose a segmentation framework to detect chest regions in CT images, which are infected by COVID-19. We use an architecture similar to U-Net model, and train it to detect ground glass regions, on pixel level. As the infected regions tend to form a connected component (rather than randomly distributed pixels), we add a suitable regularization term to the loss function, to promote connectivity of the segmentation map for COVID-19 pixels. 2D-anisotropic total-variation is used for this purpose, and therefore the proposed model is called ""TV-UNet"". Through experimental results on a relatively large-scale CT segmentation dataset of around 900 images, we show that adding this new regularization term leads to 2\% gain on overall segmentation performance compared to the U-Net model. Our experimental analysis, ranging from visual evaluation of the predicted segmentation results to quantitative assessment of segmentation performance (precision, recall, Dice score, and mIoU) demonstrated great ability to identify COVID-19 associated regions of the lungs, achieving a mIoU rate of over 99\%, and a Dice score of around 86\%."
814,10032020032770,"Background: A novel coronavirus named as ""SARS-CoV-2"" has spread widely in many countries since December 2019, especially in China. This study aimed to quantify the age-specific transmissibility by using a mathematical model. Methods: An age-specific susceptible - exposed - symptomatic - asymptomatic - recovered - seafood market (SEIARW) model was developed based on two suspected transmission routes (from market to person and person to person). The susceptible people from Wuhan City were divided into different age groups. We used the subscript i and j to represent age group 1 to 4 (1: <= 14 years; 2: 15-44 years; 3: 45-64 years; 4: >= 65 years) and 1 to 5 (1: <= 5 years; 2: 6-14 years; 3: 15-24 years; 4: 25-59 years; 4: >= 60 years), respectively. Data of reported COVID-19 cases were collected from one published literature from 26 November to 22 December, 2019 in Wuhan City, China. The age-specific transmissibility of the virus was estimated accordingly secondary attack rate (SAR). Results: The age-specific SEIARW model fitted with the reported data well by dividing the population into four age groups (χ2 = 4.99 × 10-6, P > 0.999), and five age groups (χ2 = 4.85 × 10-6, P > 0.999). Based on the four-age-group SEIARW model, the highest transmissibility occurred from age group 2 to 3 (SAR23 = 17.56 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 3 to 2 (SAR32 = 10.17 per 10 million persons). The lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 1 to 2 (SAR12 = 0.002 per 10 million persons). Based on the five-age-group SEIARW model, the highest transmissibility occurred from age group 4 to 5 (SAR45 = 12.40 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 5 to 4 (SAR54 = 6.61 per 10 million persons). The lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 3 to 4 (SAR34 = 0.0002 per 10 million persons). Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 has high transmissibility among adults and elder people but low transmissibility among children and young people."
815,10082020080550,"The ocular surface, which forms the interface between the eye and the external environment, includes the cornea, corneoscleral limbus, the conjunctiva and the accessory glands that produce the tear film. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and proteoglycans (PGs) have been shown to play important roles in the development, hemostasis and pathology of the ocular surface. Herein we review the current literature related to the distribution and function of GAGs and PGs within the ocular surface, with focus on the cornea. The unique organization of ECM components within the cornea is essential for the maintenance of corneal transparency and function. Many studies have described the importance of GAGs within the epithelial and stromal compartment, while very few studies have analyzed the ECM of the endothelial layer. Importantly, GAGs have been shown to be essential for maintaining corneal homeostasis, epithelial cell differentiation and wound healing, and, more recently, a role has been suggested for the ECM in regulating limbal stem cells, corneal innervation, corneal inflammation, corneal angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. Reports have also associated genetic defects of the ECM to corneal pathologies. Thus, we also highlight the role of different GAGs and PGs in ocular surface homeostasis, as well as in pathology."
816,100720200711060,"Multiple studies have suggested the spread of COVID-19 is affected by factors such as climate, BCG vaccinations, pollution and blood type. We perform a joint study of these factors using the death growth rates of 40 regions worldwide with both machine learning and Bayesian methods. We find weak, non-significant (< 3 sigma) evidence for temperature and relative humidity as factors in the spread of COVID-19 but little or no evidence for BCG vaccination prevalence or PM2.5 pollution. The only variable detected at a statistically significant level (> 3 sigma) is the rate of positive COVID-19 tests, with higher positive rates correlating with higher daily growth of deaths."
817,10132021018698,"BACKGROUND: Globally, case fatality rate is more in males compared to females. Some studies have suggested. It is hypothesized that estrogen hormone may decrease susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2.) OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the gender differences in SARS CoV-2 outcomes and to analyze if there are any differences in outcomes in premenopausal females compared to postmenopausal females. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients tested positive for SARS CoV-2 through real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction by Thermo Fischer Taqpath assay approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research were included in the study. The data obtained was analyzed for the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics from their medical records. RESULTS: The mortality rate in females was 12.6%, whereas mortality in males was 19.4%. In between-group analysis, 8.6% (16/185) of females died in premenopausal age group versus 12.8% (27/211) in postmenopausal group. The proportion of females who expired due to COVID significantly differ by age and postmenopausal status X2 (1, n = 293) = 7.2, the P value is 0.007. The difference is statistically significant at P < 0.05. Postmenopausal women were more likely to expire due to COVID-19 infection compared to premenopausal women. CONCLUSION: The mortality rate in postmenopausal age group was greater than mortality in premenopausal females emphasizing the protection provided by estrogens hormone in them. Postmenopausal women are also at higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection than premenopausal women. Mortality is greater in males compared to females, further strengthening the role of estrogens."
818,101520210313570,"OBJECTIVE: The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is one of the zoonotic coronaviruses [Hemida Peer J 7:e7556, 2019; Hemida et al. One Health 8:100102, 2019]. The dromedary camels remained the only known animal reservoir for this virus. Several aspects of the transmission cycle of the virus between animals, including arthropod-borne infection, is still largely unknown. The main objective of the current work was to study the possibility of MERS-CoV transmission through some arthropod vectors, particularly the hard ticks. To achieve this objective, we identified a positive MERS-CoV dromedary camel herd using the commercial available real-time PCR kits. We collected some arthropods, particularly the ticks from these positive animals as well as from the animal habitats. We tested these arthropods for the presence of MERS-CoV viral RNAs. RESULTS: Our results showing the absence of any detectable MERS-CoV-RNAs in these arthropods despite these animals were actively shedding the virus in their nasal secretions. Our results are confirming for the first the failure of detection of the MERS-CoV in ticks infesting dromedary camels. Failure of the detection of MERS-CoV in ticks infesting positive naturally infected MERS-CoV camels is strongly suggesting that ticks do not play roles in the transmission of the virus among the animals and close contact humans."
819,10012020010914,"The recent outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China caused by the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emphasizes the importance of detecting novel viruses and predicting their risks of infecting people. In this report, we introduced the VHP (Virus Host Prediction) to predict the potential hosts of viruses using deep learning algorithm. Our prediction suggests that 2019-nCoV has close infectivity with other human coronaviruses, especially the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Bat SARS-like Coronaviruses and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Based on our prediction, compared to the Coronaviruses infecting other vertebrates, bat coronaviruses are assigned with more similar infectivity patterns with 2019-nCoVs. Furthermore, by comparing the infectivity patterns of all viruses hosted on vertebrates, we found mink viruses show a closer infectivity pattern to 2019-nCov. These consequences of infectivity pattern analysis illustrate that bat and mink may be two candidate reservoirs of 2019-nCov.These results warn us to beware of 2019-nCoV and guide us to further explore the properties and reservoir of it. It is of great value to identify whether a newly discovered virus has the risk of infecting human. Guo et al. proposed a virus host prediction method based on deep learning to detect what kind of host a virus can infect with DNA sequence as input. Applied to the Wuhan 2019 Novel Coronavirus, our prediction demonstrated that several vertebrate-infectious coronaviruses have strong potential to infect human. This method will be helpful in future viral analysis and early prevention and control of viral pathogens."

821,10072020075980,"Cepharanthine (CEP) is a naturally occurring alkaloid derived from Stephania cepharantha Hayata and demonstrated to have unique anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, immunomodulating, antiparasitic, and antiviral properties. Its therapeutic potential as an antiviral agent has never been more important than in combating COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Cepharanthine suppresses nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation, lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide (NO) production, cytokine production, and expression of cyclooxygenase; all of which are crucial to viral replication and inflammatory response. Against SARS-CoV-2 and homologous viruses, CEP predominantly inhibits viral entry and replication at low doses; and was recently identified as the most potent coronavirus inhibitor among 2406 clinically approved drug repurposing candidates in a preclinical model. This review critically analyzes and consolidates available evidence establishing CEP’s potential therapeutic importance as a drug of choice in managing COVID-19 cases."

823,10142021029284,"Remote in-home infant monitoring technologies hold great promise for increasing the scalability and safety of infant research (including in regard to the current Covid-19 pandemic), but remain rarely employed. These technologies hold a number of fundamental challenges and ethical concerns that need addressing to aid the success of this fast-growing field. In particular, the responsible development of such technologies requires caregiver input. We conducted a survey of the opinions of 410 caregivers on the viability, privacy and data access of remote in-home monitoring technologies and study designs. Infant-friendly wearable devices (such as sensing body suits) were viewed favourably. Caregivers were marginally more likely to accept video and audio recording in the home if data was anonymised (through automated processing) at point of collection, particularly when observations were lengthy. Caregivers were more open to international data sharing for anonymous data. Caregivers were interested in viewing all types of data, but were particularly keen to access video and audio recordings for censoring purposes (i.e., to delete data segments). Taken together, our results indicate generally positive attitudes to remote in-home monitoring technologies and studies for infant research but highlight specific considerations such as safety, privacy and family practicalities (e.g. multiple caregivers, visitors and varying schedules) that must be taken into account when developing future studies."
824,101420210212246,"Viruses evolve extremely quickly, so reliable methods for viral host prediction are necessary to safeguard biosecurity and biosafety alike. Novel human-infecting viruses are difficult to detect with standard bioinformatics workflows. Here, we predict whether a virus can infect humans directly from next-generation sequencing reads. We show that deep neural architectures significantly outperform both shallow machine learning and standard, homology-based algorithms, cutting the error rates in half and generalizing to taxonomic units distant from those presented during training. Further, we develop a suite of interpretability tools and show that it can be applied also to other models beyond the host prediction task. We propose a new approach for convolutional filter visualization to disentangle the information content of each nucleotide from its contribution to the final classification decision. Nucleotide-resolution maps of the learned associations between pathogen genomes and the infectious phenotype can be used to detect regions of interest in novel agents, for example, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, unknown before it caused a COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. All methods presented here are implemented as easy-to-install packages not only enabling analysis of NGS datasets without requiring any deep learning skills, but also allowing advanced users to easily train and explain new models for genomics."
825,10152021033205,"Acanthamoeba is an opportunistic protozoan pathogen which is found in diverse environment worldwide. Being ubiquitous nature of this amoeba we come across it in our daily life. Acanthamoeba species are recognized as human pathogens; that may cause blinding keratitis and rare but fatal granulomatous encephalitis involving central nervous system. To date, there is not a single report in literature demonstrating anti-Acanthamoeba antibodies among the Saudi population, and thus aim of the present study. Using ELISA, we identified the antibody level in the local population. Our results represent the secretory IgA antiAcanthamoeba in mucosal secretions from 133 individuals aged 15-60 years. The antiAcanthamoeba antibody prevalence rate was > 80%, and no considerable differences were observed between prevalence in males (80.28%) and that in females (80.64%). In addition, environmental sources (soil and water) from the environment of the participants in our study were evaluated for amoeba incidence. The amoeba was identified by morphological characteristics of cysts or trophozoites on non-nutrient agar plates grown with E. coli. Overall, 58.75% of samples from water and 32.85% of those from soil were culture positive for outgrowth of amoeba on non-nutrient agar plates. Furthermore, PCR was carried out with genus-specific primers to confirm the presence of Acanthamoeba DNA. Our results revealed that about 68% of cultures from water and 43% of those from soil were successfully amplified and proved to be amoeba DNA. Interestingly, a few samples yielded more than one product, which suggests that some other amoebic species may be present in the same sample (MAC-W1 and MADW1). To the best of our knowledge, we described for the first time the amoeba isolation from the participant's close environment and antibodies level among Saudi population. Our future studies will be focused on additional molecular characterization of isolated amoeba and their pathogenic potential which could be a possible threat for the community."
826,101320210110617,"As both a computational and an experimental endeavor, ancestral sequence reconstruction remains a timely and important technique. Modern approaches to conduct ancestral sequence reconstruction for proteins are built upon a conceptual framework from journal founder Emile Zuckerkandl. On top of this, work on maximum likelihood phylogenetics published in Journal of Molecular Evolution in 1996 was one of the first approaches for generating maximum likelihood ancestral sequences of proteins. From its computational history, future model development needs as well as potential applications in areas as diverse as computational systems biology, molecular community ecology, infectious disease therapeutics and other biomedical applications, and biotechnology are discussed. From its past in this journal, there is a bright future for ancestral sequence reconstruction in the field of evolutionary biology."
827,10082020081896,"The operational and policy complexity of civil-military relations (CMR) during public health emergencies, especially those involving militaries from outside the state concerned, is addressed in several guiding international documents. Generally, these documents reflect humanitarian perspectives and doctrine at the time of their drafting, and primarily address foreign military involvement in natural and humanitarian disasters. However, in the past decade, there have been significant changes in the geopolitical environment and global health landscapes. Foreign militaries have been increasingly deployed to public health emergencies with responses grounded in public health (rather than humanitarian) approaches, while public health issues are of increasing importance in other deployments. This paper reviews key international policy documents that regulate, guide or otherwise inform CMR in the context of recent events involving international CMR during public health emergency responses, grounded in analysis of a March 2017 Chatham House roundtable event on the subject. Major thematic concerns regarding the application of existing CMR guiding documents to public health emergencies became evident. These include a lack of consideration of public health factors as distinct from a humanitarian approach; the assertion of state sovereignty vis-à-vis the deployment of national militaries; the emergence of new armed, military and security groups and a lack of consensus surrounding the 'principle of last resort'. These criticisms and gaps-in particular, a consideration for public health contexts and approaches therein-should form the basis of future CMR drafting or revision processes to ensure effective, safe, and sustainable CMR during public health emergency response."
828,10162021043240,Background: Telemedicine use became widespread at our weight management center in 2020 due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine patient and provider satisfaction with telemedicine visits at a community-based hospital in the United States. Methods: Patients and providers were electronically surveyed at the end of 2020 regarding telemedicine visit experiences. These visits took place throughout the majority of 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: A total of 85.7% (6) of providers reported spending the same or less time on telemedicine visits compared with in-person visits. All providers were either somewhat or very satisfied with the interpersonal connections made in telemedicine visits. All providers wished to see telemedicine visits continued in the future. A total of 355 patients responded. Over 90% of participants reported feeling comfortable speaking to their provider about personal issues through telemedicine. Around 73.2% of patients were very satisfied with their telemedicine visit. Around 69.8% of patients report that they would like to use either primarily telemedicine visits or a combination of telemedicine and in-person visits when it is safe to return to in-person care. Conclusions: Patients and providers exhibited high levels of satisfaction with telemedicine use in a weight management center. They both wish to see these visit types offered in the future. Patients who saved more than 30 min of time traveling with a telemedicine visit were significantly more likely to show high levels of satisfaction. Patients who found it easier to connect with the virtual platforms also were significantly more likely to have higher satisfaction levels.
829,10072020073329,"The current pandemic SARS-CoV-2 has wreaked havoc in the world, and neither drugs nor vaccine is available for the treatment of this disease. Thus, there is an immediate need for novel therapeutics that can combat this deadly infection. In this study, we report the therapeutic assessment of azurin and its peptides: p18 and p28 against the viral structural S-protein and non-structural 3CLpro and PLpro proteins. Among the analyzed complexes, azurin docked relatively well with the S2 domain of S-protein compared to the other viral proteins. The derived peptide p18 bound to the active site domain of the PLpro protein; however, in other complexes, lesser interactions were recorded. The second azurin derived peptide p28, fared the best among the docked proteins. p28 interacted with all the three viral proteins and the host ACE-2 receptor by forming several electrostatic and hydrogen bonds with the S-protein, 3CLpro, and PLpro. MD simulations indicated that p28 exhibited a strong affinity to S-protein and ACE-2 receptor, indicating a possibility of p28 as a protein-protein interaction inhibitor. Our data suggest that the p28 has potential as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent and can be further exploited to establish its validity in the treatment of current and future SARS-CoV crisis.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

830,10042020045339,"Abstract Background In a few discharged patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the nucleic acid test shows positive results again. Whether this is due to relapse of the disease, reinfection by the virus, or a false-positive result at hospital discharge is worth exploring. Case presentation A woman with COVID-19 was discharged from the hospital after integrative treatment with traditional Chinese and Western medicine because she met the discharge standards. However, she obtained positive results on a nucleic acid test 22 days later. Conclusion Based on this positive test result in a discharged patient with COVID-19, anal tests and coronavirus antibody tests should be combined with throat swab tests to further develop the diagnosis and discharge standards for patients with COVID-19."

832,101520210313216,"Intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and mortality in severe COVID-19 patients are driven by “cytokine storms” and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Interim clinical trial results suggest that the corticosteroid dexamethasone displays better 28-day survival in severe COVID-19 patients requiring ventilation or oxygen. In this study, 10 out of 16 patients (62.5%) that had an average plasma IL-6 value over 10 pg/mL post administration of corticosteroids also had worse outcomes (i.e., ICU stay >15 days or death), compared to 8 out of 41 patients (19.5%) who did not receive corticosteroids (p-value = 0.0024). Given this potential association between post-corticosteroid IL-6 levels and COVID-19 severity, we hypothesized that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR or NR3C1) may be coupled to IL-6 expression in specific cell types that govern cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Examining single-cell RNA-seq data from BALF of severe COVID-19 patients and nearly 2 million cells from a pan-tissue scan shows that alveolar macrophages, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells co-express NR3C1 and IL-6, motivating future studies on the links between the regulation of NR3C1 function and IL-6 levels."

Increasing age and presence of co-morbidities are reported risk factors for severe disease and mortality, along with autoimmune diseases (ADs) and immunosuppressive treatments such as haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), which are also associated with adverse outcomes. We review the impact of the pandemic on specific groups of patients with neurological, rheumatological, and gastroenterological indications, along with the challenges delivering HSCT in adult and pediatric populations. Moving forward, we developed consensus-based guidelines and recommendations for best practice and quality of patient care in order to support clinicians, scientists, and their multidisciplinary teams, as well as patients and their carers. These guidelines aim to support national and international organizations related to autoimmune diseases and local clinical teams delivering HSCT. Areas of unmet need and future research questions are also highlighted. The waves of the COVID-19 pandemic are predicted to be followed by an “endemic” phase and therefore an ongoing risk within a “new normality”. These recommendations reflect currently available evidence, coupled with expert opinion, and will be revised according to necessary modifications in practice."
834,10082020087559,"The Chinese government promotes the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as a global strategy for regional integration and infrastructure investment. With a projected US$1 trillion commitment from Chinese financial institutions, and at least 138 countries participating, the BRI is attracting intense debate. Yet most analysis to date focuses on broad drivers, risks, and opportunities, largely considered to be emanating from a coherent policy imposed by Beijing. In this special issue, we instead examine the BRI as a relational, contested process - a bundle of intertwined discourses, policies, and projects that sometimes align but are sometimes contradictory. We move beyond policy-level, macro-economic, and classic geopolitical analysis to study China's global investments “from the ground”. Our case studies reveal the BRI to be dynamic and unstable, rhetorically appropriated for different purposes that sometimes but do not always coalesce as a coherent geopolitical and geoeconomic strategy. The papers in this special issue provide one of the first collections of deep empirical work on the BRI and a useful approach for grounding China's role in globalization in the critical contexts of complex local realities."

836,10122020127954,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) encoded by DNA genomes have been identified across host and pathogen species as parts of the transcriptome. Accumulating evidences indicate that circRNAs play critical roles in autoimmune diseases and viral pathogenesis. Here we report that RNA viruses of the Betacoronavirus genus of Coronaviridae, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, encode a novel type of circRNAs. Through de novo circRNA analyses of publicly available coronavirus-infection related deep RNA-Sequencing data, we identified 351, 224 and 2,764 circRNAs derived from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and characterized two major back-splice events shared by these viruses. Coronavirus-derived circRNAs are more abundant and longer compared to host genome-derived circRNAs. Using a systematic strategy to amplify and identify back-splice junction sequences, we experimentally identified over 100 viral circRNAs from SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cells. This collection of circRNAs provided the first line of evidence for the abundance and diversity of coronavirus-derived circRNAs and suggested possible mechanisms driving circRNA biogenesis from RNA genomes. Our findings highlight circRNAs as an important component of the coronavirus transcriptome. Summary We report for the first time that abundant and diverse circRNAs are generated by SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and represent a novel type of circRNAs that differ from circRNAs encoded by DNA genomes."

The COVID-19 pandemic will imply significant changes in the reorientation of dental practices, from biosafety issues to technical procedures. Greater rigor in the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) may cause strangeness for children. Consequently, an improvement in the management of patient’s behavior before and during the treatment and new approaches to perform the procedures will be demanded. Non-aerosol techniques and minimally invasive procedures will be preferable whenever possible. Professionals will need to be constantly updated based on what the scientific literature recommends. The moment is suitable for the use of preventive practice and minimally invasive techniques."
838,10112020111944,"Importance Full-thickness tracheal lesions and tracheoesophageal fistulas are severe complications of invasive mechanical ventilation. The incidence of tracheal complications in ventilated patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unknown. Objective To evaluate whether patients with COVID-19 have a higher incidence of full-thickness tracheal lesions and tracheoesophageal fistulas than matched controls and to investigate potential mechanisms. Design, Setting, and Participants This is a retrospective cohort study in patients admitted to the intensive care unit in a tertiary referral hospital. Among 98 consecutive patients with COVID-19 with severe respiratory failure, 30 underwent prolonged (≥14 days) invasive mechanical ventilation and were included in the COVID-19 group. The control group included 45 patients without COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 were selected from March 1 to May 31, 2020, while the control group was selected from March 1 to May 31, 2019. Exposures Patients with COVID-19 had severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection diagnosed by nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs and were treated according to local therapeutic procedures. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary study outcome was the incidence of full-thickness tracheal lesions or tracheoesophageal fistulas in patients with prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation. Results The mean (SD) age was 68.8 (9.0) years in the COVID-19 group and 68.5 (14.1) years in the control group (effect size, 0.3; 95% CI, -5.0 to 5.6). Eight (27%) and 15 (33%) women were enrolled in the COVID-19 group and the control group, respectively. Fourteen patients (47%) in the COVID-19 group had full-thickness tracheal lesions (n = 10, 33%) or tracheoesophageal fistulas (n = 4, 13%), while 1 patient (2.2%) in the control group had a full-thickness tracheal lesion (odds ratio, 38.4; 95% CI, 4.7 to 316.9). Clinical and radiological presentations of tracheal lesions were pneumomediastinum (n = 10, 71%), pneumothorax (n = 6, 43%), and/or subcutaneous emphysema (n = 13, 93%). Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study, almost half of patients with COVID-19 developed full-thickness tracheal lesions and/or tracheoesophageal fistulas after prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation. Attempts to prevent these lesions should be made and quickly recognized when they occur to avoid potentially life-threatening complications in ventilated patients with COVID-19."
839,101420210212520,"The effect of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity on the immune response to mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has not been well-described. Here we report longitudinal SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses pre- and post-vaccination among a cohort of healthcare personnel, with and without prior infection, from a large academic medical center. Our results provide preliminary evidence that prior SARS-CoV-2 infection may prime the response to the first mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose. These findings could have significant impact on the allocation of mRNA-based vaccines and support the need for future research into the effect of prior infection on magnitude and durability of vaccination response."
840,10162021043526,"The proposed triple aim of health care-enhanced patient experience, improved population health, and reduced per capita costs-can be applied to clinical research. A triple aim for clinical research would (1) improve the individual research participant's experience; (2) promote the health of populations; and (3) reduce per capita costs of clinical research. Such an approach is possible by designing trials around the needs of participants rather than sites, embracing digital measures of health, and advancing decentralized studies. Recent studies, including those evaluating therapies for COVID-19, have demonstrated the value of such an approach. Accelerating the adoption of these methods can help fulfill this new triple aim of clinical research."
841,10102020105730,Off-label tocilizumab use in COVID-19 patients reflects concern for cytokine release syndrome. Comparison of matched COVID-19 pneumonia patients found elevated IL-6 levels correlated with mortality that did not change with tocilizumab administration. Correlating mortality with increased IL-6 doesn’t imply causality however lack of improvement by tocilizumab requires further clinical trial alterations.
842,10042020042330,"INTRODUCTION To review the present literature on upper respiratory tract sampling in COVID-19 and provide recommendations to improve healthcare practices and directions in future studies. METHODS Twelve relevant manuscripts were sourced from a total of 7288 search results obtained using PubMed, Medline and Google Scholar. The search keywords used were COVID-19, nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, swabs, SARS and CoV2. Original manuscripts were obtained and analysed by all authors. The review included manuscripts which have not undergone rigorous peer-review process in view of the magnitude of the topic discussed. RESULTS The viral load of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the upper respiratory tract was significantly higher during the first week and peaked at 4-6 days after onset of symptoms, during which it can be potentially sampled. Nasopharyngeal swab has demonstrated higher viral load than oropharyngeal swab, where the difference in paired samples is best seen at 0-9 days after the onset of illness. Sensitivity of nasopharyngeal swab was higher than oropharyngeal swabs in COVID-19 patients. Patient self-collected throat washing has been shown to contain higher viral load than nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab, with significantly higher sensitivity when compared with paired nasopharyngeal swab. RECOMMENDATIONS Routine nasopharyngeal swab of suspected COVID-19 infection should take anatomy of the nasal cavity into consideration to increase patient comfort and diagnostic yield. Routine oropharyngeal swab should be replaced by throat washing which has demonstrated better diagnostic accuracy, and it is safe towards others."
843,100620200610030,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic related to 1) levels of worry, risk perception, and social distancing; 2) longitudinal effects on wellbeing; and 3) effects of worry, risk perception, and social distancing on wellbeing. METHODS: We analyzed annual changes in four aspects of wellbeing over five years (2015–2020): life satisfaction, financial satisfaction, self-rated health, and loneliness in a subsample (n=1071, aged 60–71) from a larger survey of Swedish older adults. The 2020 wave, collected March 26–April 2, included measures of worry, risk perception, and social distancing in response to COVID-19. RESULTS: 1) In relation to COVID-19: 44.9% worried about health, 69.5% about societal consequences, 25.1% about financial consequences; 86.4% perceived a high societal risk, 42.3% a high risk of infection, and 71.2% reported high levels of social distancing. 2) Wellbeing remained stable (life satisfaction and loneliness) or even increased (self-rated health and financial satisfaction) in 2020 compared to previous years. 3) More worry about health and financial consequences was related to lower scores in all four wellbeing measures. Higher societal worry and more social distancing were related to higher wellbeing. DISCUSSION: In the early stage of the pandemic, Swedish older adults on average rated their wellbeing as high as, or even higher than, previous years. However, those who worried more reported lower wellbeing. Our findings speak to the resilience, but also heterogeneity, among older adults during the pandemic. Further research, on a broad range of health factors and long-term psychological consequences, is needed."
844,10072020074320,"Mammals localize sounds using information from their two ears. Localization in real-world conditions is challenging, as echoes provide erroneous information, and noises mask parts of target sounds. To better understand real-world localization we equipped a deep neural network with human ears and trained it to localize sounds in a virtual environment. The resulting model localized accurately in realistic conditions with noise and reverberation, outperforming alternative systems that lacked human ears. In simulated experiments, the network exhibited many features of human spatial hearing: sensitivity to monaural spectral cues and interaural time and level differences, integration across frequency, and biases for sound onsets. But when trained in unnatural environments without either reverberation, noise, or natural sounds, these performance characteristics deviated from those of humans. The results show how biological hearing is adapted to the challenges of real-world environments and illustrate how artificial neural networks can extend traditional ideal observer models to real-world domains."
845,10162021044249,"Variation in immune homeostasis, immune system stability, in organ systems such as the lungs is likely to shape the host response to infection at these exposed tissues. We evaluated immune homeostasis in immune cell populations in the lungs of the Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse genetic reference population. We found vast heritable variation in leukocyte populations with the frequency of many of these cell types showing distinct patterns relative to classic inbred strains C57BL/6J and BALB/cJ. We identified 28 quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with variation in baseline lung immune cell populations, including several loci that broadly regulate the abundance of immune populations from distinct developmental lineages, and found that many of these loci have predictive value for influenza disease outcomes, demonstrating that genetic determinants of homeostatic immunity in the lungs regulate susceptibility to virus-induced disease. All told, we highlight the need to assess diverse mouse strains in understanding immune homeostasis and resulting immune responses."
846,10092020095184,"Our study systematically reviews articles about the prevalence of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) among children and adolescents, aiming to evaluate its prevalence after earthquakes and floods.Three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) were searched for articles published from 1981 to 2019 containing information on PTSD prevalence among survivors of earthquakes and floods. Articles with insufficient data on the prevalence of PTSD or without any available full-text were excluded. Major study variables consist of the prevalence of PTSD of the included studies, gender, and the elapsed time after the disaster. The overall PTSD prevalence was determined using a fixed-effect model for eligible studies. Of 4107 studies listed using our search strategy, 439 underwent full-text review, 59 records included in the systematic review, and 39 records met the criteria for meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of PTSD among children and adolescent survivors after earthquakes and floods was 19.2% (95%CI = 18.6-19.7%), 30.0% (95%CI = 29.5-30.6%), 24.4% (95%CI = 23.4-25.4%) and 20.4% (95%CI = 19.1-21.7%), in the first, second, third and fourth six-month intervals after the disaster, respectively. Our analysis also revealed that PTSD was more prevalent among girls (p < 0.001). The absence of psychological support for affected areas considerably increases the risk of PTSD among survivors. Our results indicated that children and adolescents, especially girls, are more vulnerable and should be in top priority. The governments should refine their policies on post-disaster services and run early screening, immediate intervention, and ongoing monitoring for PTSD, as well as mental and emotional supports."
847,10072020072989,"The Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) is making great strides in promoting patient and public involvement (PPI) in health research across Europe, supporting patient organisations to be involved in the projects that it funds. Despite this, the literature around PPI in health services and research originating from European countries appears less than from the United Kingdom (UK), where PPI is well established. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to explore the attitudes and approaches to PPI across Europe. Eight scientific databases were systematically searched and data extracted. Data quality was assessed using a checklist based on the Guidance for Reporting Involvement of Patients and the Public (GRIPP2) (Staniszewska et al., Research, Involvement and Engagement, 3, 13, 2017) and the critical appraisal guidelines developed by Wright et al. (Health Expectations, 13, 359, 2010). We included all studies reporting PPI activity in both public and private health services and research institutions in the World Health Organization European region, excluding the UK, published in the English language from 1996 to 2018. Forty studies in total were included in the analysis. The studies imply a growing interest and support for the idea of PPI in health services and, to a lesser extent, in health research. There seems to be a convergence of conceptualisations of PPI across Europe, with internationally significant areas of innovative work taking place in countries such as the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries. However, the implementation of PPI is highly uneven, and PPI is not yet firmly embedded or adequately formalised in European healthcare systems and research, possibly due to a lack of infrastructure, guidance and support. In order to try to get a better understanding of what is happening on the ground, we are carrying out a survey with potential follow-up interviews as the next part of this research project. This work is currently on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic."
848,10042020044999,"Emerging infectious diseases in humans are frequently caused by pathogens originating from animal hosts, and zoonotic disease outbreaks present a major challenge to global health. To investigate drivers of virus spillover, we evaluated the number of viruses mammalian species have shared with humans. We discovered that the number of zoonotic viruses detected in mammalian species scales positively with global species abundance, suggesting that virus transmission risk has been highest from animal species that have increased in abundance and even expanded their range by adapting to human-dominated landscapes. Domesticated species, primates and bats were identified as having more zoonotic viruses than other species. Among threatened wildlife species, those with population reductions owing to exploitation and loss of habitat shared more viruses with humans. Exploitation of wildlife through hunting and trade facilitates close contact between wildlife and humans, and our findings provide further evidence that exploitation, as well as anthropogenic activities that have caused losses in wildlife habitat quality, have increased opportunities for animal–human interactions and facilitated zoonotic disease transmission. Our study provides new evidence for assessing spillover risk from mammalian species and highlights convergent processes whereby the causes of wildlife population declines have facilitated the transmission of animal viruses to humans."
849,10062020068908,"The application of surface electromyography (sEMG) in neurology is sometimes limited by a scientific background in the use of sEMG. Students frequently use sEMG only when developing their graduate studies. To reduce these barriers, we promoted a free Winter School on sEMG to Latin American students. The school was a 3-day event with theoretical classes and computer programming in Matlab. Lectures were delivered in Portuguese and Spanish to 50 participants. All lectures were recorded and made available on YouTube®. After the School, participants completed a written exam to receive a certificate. The written exam revealed the average effectiveness of 71 ± 20% in the comprehension of topics addressed during the school. Participants rated the School as “excellent” and considered the event as having changed their thoughts about the use of sEMG. Limited mathematical skills or background were the main barriers identified to follow the lectures and to make use of sEMG. We conclude that the Winter School had a positive impact on participant's formation, especially by showing them the importance of continuous involvement with the concepts related to sEMG to become proficient in its use. From the participant's point of view, the activity was excellent and the follow up of the school on YouTube® suggests that combining face-to-face activities followed by the online availability of lectures is a valid strategy to reinforce the learning process and to reduce barriers in the use of sEMG. Whether similar results would be achieved for a paid registration event in an economically developing region, still requires further investigation."
850,10172021058861,"Compelling pieces of evidence derived from both clinical and experimental research has demonstrated the crucial role of the receptor for advanced-glycation end-products (RAGE) in orchestrating a plethora of proinflammatory cellular responses leading to many of the complications and end-organ damages reported in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many clinical reports have pointed out that DM increases the risk of COVID-19 complications, hospitalization requirements, as well as the overall severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 case-fatality rate. In the present review, we intend to focus on how the basal activation state of the RAGE axis in common preexisting conditions in DM patients such as endothelial dysfunction and hyperglycemia-related prothrombotic phenotype, as well as the contribution of RAGE signaling in lung inflammation, may then lead to the increased mortality risk of COVID-19 in these patients. Additionally, the cross-talk between the RAGE axis with either another severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 receptor molecule different of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 or the renin-angiotensin system imbalance produced by viral infection, as well as the role of this multi-ligand receptor on the obesity-associated low-grade inflammation in the higher risk for severe illness reported in diabetes patients with COVID-19, are also discussed."
851,10032020032016,"In the last 12 years, every Canadian province and territory has undertaken significant health services restructuring, with the pace of change accelerating recently. When the H1N1 Pandemic Influenza (PI) hit Alberta in the spring of 2009, the province had just begun a restructuring of health services of a scale unprecedented in Canada. The new province-wide entity, Alberta Health Services (AHS), was faced with mounting an effective response to a global communicable disease outbreak during a time of great organizational flux. In this retrospective, the authors reflect on challenges and opportunities presented during the AHS PI response related to the coordination of public health, laboratory services, emergency and disaster management, communications, and health services delivery. Lessons learned are shared that may be helpful to other provinces and territories as they continue to evolve their systems, so that they may be better prepared to respond to an untimely event such as a pandemic."

853,10082020080236,"Neurological and neurosurgical early rehabilitation patients are often so critically ill that they must be weaned from mechanical ventilation in addition to early rehabilitative treatment. The German Society for Neurorehabilitation (DGNR) carried out a survey and asked neurological weaning units to provide information on structural characteristics of the facility, including personnel and technical resources and the number of cases and outcome based on anonymous data. In total 36 weaning units from 11 federal states with a total of 496 beds participated in the survey. From 2516 weaning cases documented in 2019, 2097 (83.3%) could primarily be successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation and only 120 (4.8%) had to be discharged with home ventilation. The mortality in this sample was 11.0% (n = 276). The results of the survey demonstrate that prolonged weaning during early neurological and neurosurgical rehabilitation is an important and effective component of healthcare provision for critically ill patients in Germany."
854,10062020061092,"Deep neural network (DNN) classifiers have attained remarkable performance in diagnosing known diseases when the models are trained on a large amount of data from known diseases. However, DNN classifiers trained on known diseases usually fail when they confront new diseases such as COVID-19. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning framework and pipeline for explainable medical imaging that can classify known diseases as well as detect new/unknown diseases when the models are only trained on known disease images. We first provide in-depth mathematical analysis to explain the overconfidence phenomena and present the calibrated confidence that can mitigate the overconfidence. Using calibrated confidence, we design a decision engine to determine if a medical image belongs to some known diseases or a new disease. At last, we introduce a new visual explanation to further reveal the suspected region inside each image. Using both Skin Lesion and Chest X-Ray datasets, we validate that our framework significantly improves the accuracy of new disease discovery, i.e., distinguish COVID-19 from pneumonia without seeing any COVID-19 data during training. We also qualitatively show that our visual explanations are highly consistent with doctors’ ground truth. While our work was not designed to target COVID-19, our experimental validation using the real world COVID-19 cases/data demonstrates the general applicability of our pipeline for different diseases based on medical imaging."
855,10122020126492,"The ability of health systems to cope with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is of major concern. In preparation, we used clinical pathway models to estimate healthcare requirements for COVID-19 patients in the context of broader public health measures in Australia. An age- and risk-stratified transmission model of COVID-19 demonstrated that an unmitigated epidemic would dramatically exceed the capacity of the health system of Australia over a prolonged period. Case isolation and contact quarantine alone are insufficient to constrain healthcare needs within feasible levels of expansion of health sector capacity. Overlaid social restrictions must be applied over the course of the epidemic to ensure systems do not become overwhelmed and essential health sector functions, including care of COVID-19 patients, can be maintained. Attention to the full pathway of clinical care is needed, along with ongoing strengthening of capacity."
856,101520210314579,"Background: COVID-19 pneumonia is responsible for the latest pandemic. Usage of pulmonary computed tomography (CT) scan is known to be an important method in the diagnosis of COVID-19. Here, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between CT severity score and capillary blood oxygen saturation in patients with COVID-19 infection. Methods and material: This is a cross-sectional study performed in 2020 on patients with COVID-19 infection. All patients underwent pulmonary CT scan and CT severity score was calculated. The initial capillary oxygen saturation by the time of admission was also collected. Data were collected and analyzed. Results: A total number of 270 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection entered the study. The initial mean capillary oxygen saturation was 89.65 ± 8.09%. The mean score in patients was 15.16 ± 8.08. We also indicated that 27 patients had hypoxia by the time of admission and these patients had significantly higher CT severity scores (p = 0.001). Diabetes mellitus (p = 0.001), hypertension (p = 0.001), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (p = 0.03) and totally having an underlying disease (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with decreased capillary oxygen saturation. Patients with hypertension (p = 0.001) and patients with the previous medical disease (p = 0.01) had significantly higher CT severity scores than others. There was a significant reverse relationship between CT severity score and capillary oxygen saturation (r = −0.44, p < 0.001). Conclusions: We showed that there was a significant reverse relationship between CT severity score and capillary oxygen saturation which has great clinical importance. Furthermore, we indicated that previous medical history could also play an important role in CT severity score.

857,10112020110482,"This study presents a new input parameter selection and modeling procedure in order to control and predict peak particle velocity (PPV) values induced by mine blasting. The first part of this study was performed through the use of fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) to identify the key input variables with the deepest influence on PPV based on the experts’ opinions. Then, in the second part, the most effective parameters on PPV were selected to be applied in hybrid artificial neural network (ANN)-based models i.e., genetic algorithm (GA)-ANN, particle swarm optimization (PSO)-ANN, imperialism competitive algorithm (ICA)-ANN, artificial bee colony (ABC)-ANN and firefly algorithm (FA)-ANN for the prediction of PPV. Many hybrid ANN-based models were constructed according to the most influential parameters of GA, PSO, ICA, ABC and FA optimization techniques and 5 hybrid ANN-based models were proposed to predict PPVs induced by blasting. Through simple ranking technique, the best hybrid model was selected. The obtained results revealed that the FA-ANN model is able to offer higher accuracy level for PPV prediction compared to other implemented hybrid models. Coefficient of determination (R(2)) results of (0.8831, 0.8995, 0.9043, 0.9095 and 0.9133) and (0.8657, 0.8749, 0.8850, 0.9094 and 0.9097) were obtained for train and test stages of GA-ANN, PSO-ANN, ICA-ANN, ABC-ANN and FA-ANN, respectively. The results showed that all hybrid models can be used to solve PPV problem, however, when the highest prediction performance is needed, the hybrid FA-ANN model would be the best choice."
858,10052020057082,"The 2019 novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak has caused a large number of deaths, with thousands of confirmed cases worldwide. The present study followed computational approaches to identify B- and T-cell epitopes for the spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 by its interactions with the human leukocyte antigen alleles. We identified 24 peptide stretches on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein that are well conserved among the reported strains. The S protein structure further validated the presence of predicted peptides on the surface, of which 20 are surface exposed and predicted to have reasonable epitope binding efficiency. The work could be useful for understanding the immunodominant regions in the surface protein of SARS-CoV-2 and could potentially help in designing some peptide-based diagnostics. Also, identified T-cell epitopes might be considered for incorporation in vaccine designs."
859,10132021011864,"One of the prominent, by now seminal, paradigms in the research tradition of cognitive dissonance (Festinger, 1957) is the free-choice paradigm developed by Brehm (1956) to measure choice-induced preference change. Some 50 years after Brehm introduced the paradigm, Chen and Risen (2010) published an influential critique arguing that what the paradigm measures is not necessarily a choice-induced preference change, but possibly an artifact of the choice revealing existing preferences. They showed that once the artifact is experimentally controlled for, there is either no or very little evidence for choice-induced preference change. Given the prominence of the paradigm, this critique meant that much of what we thought we knew about the psychological process of cognitive dissonance might not be true. Following the critique, research using the paradigm applied various corrections to overcome the artifact. The present research examined whether choice truly changes preferences, or rather merely reflects them. We conducted a meta-analysis on 43 studies (N = 2,191), all using an artifact-free free-choice paradigm. Using different meta-analytical methods, and conceptually different analyses, including a Bayesian one, we found an overall effect size of Cohen's d = 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.32, 0.49]. Furthermore, we found no evidence for publication bias as an alternative explanation for the choice-induced preference change effect. These results support the existence of true preference change created by choice. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)."
860,10142021028824,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly evolving infectious/inflammatory disorder which has turned into a global pandemic. With severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as its etiologic agent, severe COVID-19 cases usually develop uncontrolled inflammatory responses and cytokine storm-like syndromes. Measuring serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6 and others) as inflammatory biomarkers may have several potential applications in the management of COVID-19, including risk assessment, monitoring of disease progression, determination of prognosis, selection of therapy and prediction of response to treatment. This is especially true for pediatric patients with COVID-19 associated Kawasaki-like disease and similar syndromes. In this report, we review the current knowledge of COVID-19 associated cytokines, their roles in host immune and inflammatory responses, the clinical significance and utility of cytokine immunoassays in adult and pediatric COVID-19 patients, as well as the challenges and pitfalls in implementation and interpretation of cytokine immunoassays. Given that cytokines are implicated in different immunological disorders and diseases, it is challenging to interpret the multiplex cytokine data for COVID-19 patients. Also, it should be taken into consideration that biological and technical variables may affect the commutability of cytokine immunoassays and enhance complexity of cytokine immunoassay interpretation. It is recommended that the same method, platform and laboratory should be used when monitoring differences in cytokine levels between groups of individuals or for the same individual over time. It may be important to correlate cytokine profiling data with the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification testing and imaging observations to make an accurate interpretation of the inflammatory status and disease progression in COVID-19 patients."
861,10152021035112,"Background and Aims The atherosclerotic plaque microenvironment is highly complex, and selective agents that modulate plaque stability or other plaque phenotypes are not yet available. We sought to investigate the human atherosclerotic cellular environment using scRNA-seq to uncover potential therapeutic approaches. We aimed to make our workflow user-friendly, reproducible, and applicable to other disease-specific scRNA-seq datasets. Methods Here we incorporate automated cell labeling, pseudotemporal ordering, ligand-receptor evaluation, and drug-gene interaction analysis into an enhanced and reproducible scRNA-seq analysis workflow. Notably, we also developed an R Shiny based interactive web application to enable further exploration and analysis of the scRNA dataset. Results We applied this analysis workflow to a human coronary artery scRNA dataset and revealed distinct derivations of chondrocyte-like and fibroblast-like cells from smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and show the key changes in gene expression along their de-differentiation path. We highlighted several key ligand-receptor interactions within the atherosclerotic environment through functional expression profiling and revealed several attractive avenues for future pharmacological repurposing in precision medicine. Further, our interactive web application, PlaqView (www.plaqview.com), allows other researchers to easily explore this dataset and benchmark applicable scRNA-seq analysis tools without prior coding knowledge. Conclusions These results suggest novel effects of chemotherapeutics on the atherosclerotic cellular environment and provide future avenues of studies in precision medicine. This publicly available workflow will also allow for more systematic and user-friendly analysis of scRNA datasets in other disease and developmental systems. PlaqView allows for rapid visualization and analysis of atherosclerosis scRNA-seq datasets without the need of prior coding experience. Future releases of PlaqView will feature additional larger scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq atherosclerosis-related datasets, thus providing a critical resource for the field by promoting data harmonization and biological interpretation."
862,10062020066925,"The COVID-19 pandemic has raised challenges in dealing with information sharing by the public and the authorities. There are two categories of information sharing on social media that are believed to be potentially problematic and unethical: the sharing of personal information of patients and the sharing of fake news or false information. We present a discussion on how the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia can be ethically handled in terms of information sharing. It is recommended that the public should cultivate the basic skills to evaluate information and determine its validity. On the other hand, the authorities should refrain from placing the blame on patients to avoid them from being stigmatized. It is crucial that all parties are aware of their ethical duty to ensure only ethical and valid information gets shared on social media."

Particular attention is devoted to examining the usefulness of non-monotonic quantifiers, which represent a fuzzy determination of the amount of analyzed data. The answer is positive. The use of non-monotonic quantifiers in the detection of outliers can provide a more significant value of the degree of truth of a linguistic summary.

The control group of HCW has shown a strong antibody response with a median (MD (Q1; Q3)) antibody titer of 800.0 AU/mL (520.5; 800.0). In comparison to HCW, HDP under 60 years of age responded equally (597.0 AU/mL (410.5; 800.0), p = 0.051). However, the antibody responses of the HDP negatively correlated with age (r(2) = 0.2954 p < 0.0001), leading to significantly lower antibody titers in HDP over 60 years (280.0 AU/mL (45.7; 477.0), p < 0.0001). To thoroughly understand the immunogenicity of the new mRNA-based vaccines in HDP, longitudinal data on the effectiveness and durability of antibody responses are needed. Modifications of immunization schedules should be considered in HDP with low or without antibody responsiveness after standard vaccination to boost immune reactivity and prolong protective effects in these vulnerable patients."
865,10142021026809,"Following outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2002 and 2012, respectively, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the third highly pathogenic emerging human coronavirus (hCoV). SARS-CoV-2 is currently causing the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. CoV infections in target cells may stimulate the formation of numerous double-membrane autophagosomes and induce autophagy. Several studies provided evidence that hCoV infections are closely related to various cellular aspects associated with autophagy. Autophagy may even promote hCoV infection and replication. However, so far it is unclear how hCoV infections induce autophagy and whether the autophagic machinery is necessary for viral propagation. Here, we summarize the most recent advances concerning the mutual interplay between the autophagic machinery and the three emerging hCoVs, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 and the model system mouse hepatitis virus. We also discuss the applicability of approved and well-tolerated drugs targeting autophagy as a potential treatment against COVID-19."

869,10032020033308,"Currently, there are no approved specific antiviral agents for 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In this study, ten severe patients confirmed by real-time viral RNA test were enrolled prospectively. One dose of 200 mL convalescent plasma (CP) derived from recently recovered donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused to the patients as an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents. The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 days after CP transfusion. The median time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 days. After CP transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640). The clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 days. Several parameters tended to improve as compared to pre-transfusion, including increased lymphocyte counts (0.65*109/L vs. 0.76*109/L) and decreased C-reactive protein (55.98 mg/L vs. 18.13 mg/L). Radiological examinations showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesionswithin 7 days. The viral load was undetectable after transfusion in seven patients who had previous viremia. No severe adverse effects were observed. This study showed CP therapy was welltolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe COVID-19 cases. The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of CP therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials."
870,10122020129979,"BACKGROUND: An epidemic of COVID-19 broke out in Wuhan, China, since December 2019. The ordinary medical services were hindered. However, the emergency cases, including aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), still required timely intervention. Thus, it provoked challenges to the routine management protocol. In this study, we summarized our experience in the emergency management of aSAH (Beijing Tiantan Protocol, BTP) in Beijing, China. METHODS: Demographic, clinical, and imaging data of consecutive emergency aSAH patients who underwent craniotomy clipping during the COVID-19 epidemic season were reviewed and compared with the retrospective period last year. Subgroup analysis was further performed to assess the outcomes of different screening results and several detailed protocols. Neurological outcomes were evaluated by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). RESULTS: A total of 127 aSAH were referred to our emergency department, and 42 (33.1%) underwent craniotomy clipping between January 20, 2020, and March 25, 2020. The incidence of preoperative hospitalized adverse events and the perioperative outcomes were similar (− 0.1, 95% CI − 1.0 to 0.8, P = 0.779) to the retrospective period last year (January 2019–March 2019). After the propensity score matching (PSM), there were still no statistical differences in prognostic parameters between the two groups. Eight (19.0%) of the 42 individuals were initially screened as preliminary undetermined COVID-19 cases, in which 2 of them underwent craniotomy clipping in the negative pressure operating room (OR). The prognosis of patients with varied COVID-19 screening results was similar (F(2, 39) = 0.393, P = 0.678). Since February 28, 12 cases (28.6%) received COVID-19 nucleic acid testing (NAT) upon admission, and all showed negative. The false-negative rate was 0.0%. The preoperative hospitalized adverse events and postoperative prognosis were still similar between patients with and without COVID-19 NAT (− 0.3, 95% CI − 1.4 to 0.9, P = 0.653). CONCLUSIONS: Our emergency surgery management protocol (BTP) is reliable for scheduling emergency aneurysm craniotomy clipping in non-major epidemic areas."
871,10082020086647,"A novel corona virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, found in Wuhan, China in December 2019 has since spread to multiple continents and has been implicated in thousands of deaths. This pandemic—causing virus has been initially described (corona virus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) with the presentation of fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The majority of studies published have been conducted on inpatient cases and a shortage of tests has encouraged screening only of patients with classic presentation. A positive COVID-19 case of a healthy military male, with the chief complaint of anosmia and ageusia, instigated local re-evaluation of the screening protocol for possible COVID-19 patients. Multiple studies in Europe have implicated anosmia and ageusia as symptoms associated with COVID-19, and subsequently, anosmia and ageusia have been added to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention screening guidelines as well. There should be a higher index of suspicion when evaluating a patient with high-risk activities, travel, and atypical symptoms. More studies need to be conducted with a healthy outpatient population to further understand this disease and decrease its impact."
872,101520210312108,"Zoonotic pandemics, such as that caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), can follow the spillover of animal viruses into highly susceptible human populations. The descendants of these viruses have adapted to the human host and evolved to evade immune pressure. Coronaviruses acquire substitutions more slowly than other RNA viruses. In the spike glycoprotein, we found that recurrent deletions overcome this slow substitution rate. Deletion variants arise in diverse genetic and geographic backgrounds, transmit efficiently, and are present in novel lineages, including those of current global concern. They frequently occupy recurrent deletion regions (RDRs), which map to defined antibody epitopes. Deletions in RDRs confer resistance to neutralizing antibodies. By altering stretches of amino acids, deletions appear to accelerate SARS-CoV-2 antigenic evolution and may, more generally, drive adaptive evolution."

874,10102020103341,"Background Variable models of care have been adopted in different countries in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Egypt has assigned certain hospitals specifically for the quarantine of COVID-19 patients, where operational medical teams work continuously for 14 days, after which they are released for self-isolation at home for a similar period. Aims The study aimed to evaluate and compare perceived adverse psychological symptoms (stress, anxiety, depression), and insomnia by health-care professionals working in quarantine and non-quarantine hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic in Egypt, and to explore associated factors with adverse psychological symptoms and insomnia. Methods An online cross-sectional survey was performed in April 2020, using a snowball sampling method. Sociodemographic information perceived general health, healthy lifestyle, insomnia (using Insomnia Severity Index), adverse psychological symptoms (using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21), worries and concerns about COVID-19, future perspective about COVID-19, and coping strategies were collected. Results Five hundred and forty health-care professionals participated; 10.2% (n=55) worked in quarantine hospitals. Younger age (ORa=0.96, 95% CI:0.93-0.99, ORa=0.95; 95% CI:0.92-0.97; ORa=0.96 CI:0.93-0.99), being not ready/sure of readiness to work in quarantine hospital (ORa=1.91, 95% CI:1.22-3.00; ORa=2.01, 95% CI:1.28-3.15; ORa=1.91, 95% CI:1.22-2.98), and insomnia (ORa=5.22, 95% CI:3.38-8.05; ORa=7.58, 95% CI:4.91-11.68; ORa=6.38 95% CI:4.19-9.73) significantly predicted stress, depression and anxiety, respectively. Being female (ORa=1.59, 95% CI:1.04-2.42; ORa=2.09, 95% CI:1.38-3.16) could also significantly predict stress and anxiety. Conclusion Female and younger age health care professionals were more prone to report adverse psychological symptoms. More and earlier screening for health-care professionals dealing with COVID-19, in addition to providing psychological support, is highly encouraged."

Despite the significant efforts made in developing vaccines and therapeutic drugs, there is currently no available effective treatment against this new coronavirus infection, hence the need to continue research which is aimed at limiting the progression of this virus. The present study which has as objective to carry out in silico studies on the metabolites of some Cameroonian medicinal plants of the Asteraceae family with a view to propose potential molecules to fight against COVID-19. The selected plants are commonly used to treat respiratory infectious diseases, and for this reason they may contain some constituents which could exhibit an antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. In this work, a set of 74 naturally occurring compounds are computed with SARS-CoV-2 main protease protein (PDB ID: 6lu7) and spike protein (PDB ID: 6m0j) for their affinity and stability using binding energy analysis and molecular docking. Chrysoeriol-7-O-β-D-glucuronopyranoside (compound 16) has showed promising results including excellent Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME) parameters as well as insignificant toxicity. Finally, the stability of this compound is complex with the two proteins validated through molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, they displayed stable trajectory and molecular properties with consistent interaction profile in molecular dynamics simulations. These findings call for further in vitro and in vivo challenges of phytoconstituents against the COVID-19 as a potential agent to fight the spread of this dramatic pandemic.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

876,10072020072751,"A realistic three-dimensional (3D) computational model of skin flap closures using Asian-like head templates from two different genders, male and female, has been developed. The current study aimed to understand the biomechanics of the local flap designs along with the effect of wound closures on the respective genders. Two Asian head templates from opposite genders were obtained to use as base models. A third-order Yeoh hyperelastic model was adapted to characterize as skin material properties. A single layer composed of combined epidermis and dermis was considered and the models were thickened according to respective anatomical positions. Each model gender was excised with a fixed defect size which was consequently covered by three different local flap designs namely advancement, rotation, and rhomboid flaps. Post-operative simulation presented various scenarios of skin flap closures. Rotation and rhomboid flaps demonstrated maximal tension at the apex of the flap for both genders as well as advancement flap in the female face model. However, advancement flap closure in the male face model presented otherwise. Yet, the deformation patterns and the peak tension of the discussed flaps were consistent with conventional local flap surgery. Moreover, male face models generated higher stresses compared to the female face models with a 70.34% mean difference. Overall, the skin flap operations were executed manually and the designed surgery model met the objectives successfully while acknowledging the study limitations.

877,101620210412682,"Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) has become a global pandemic disease, and computed tomography-based (CT) image analysis and recognition are one of the important tools for clinical diagnosis. In order to assist medical personnel to achieve an efficient and fast diagnosis of patients with new coronavirus pneumonia, this paper proposes an assisted diagnosis algorithm based on ensemble deep learning. The method combines the Stacked Generalization ensemble learning with the VGG16 deep learning to form a cascade classifier, and the information constituting the cascade classifier comes from multiple subsets of the training set, each of which is used to collect deviant information about the generalization behavior of the data set, such that this deviant information fills the cascade classifier. The algorithm was experimentally validated for classifying patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia, patients with common pneumonia (CP), and normal controls, and the algorithm achieved a prediction accuracy of 93.57%, sensitivity of 94.21%, specificity of 93.93%, precision of 89.40%, and F1-score of 91.74% for the three categories. The results show that the method proposed in this paper has good classification performance and can significantly improve the performance of deep neural networks for multicategory prediction tasks."
878,10082020089574,"This paper analyzes the political economy causes of fiscal promise gaps, defined as the distance between planned fiscal objectives and actual realizations during planned fiscal expansions periods. Using a sample of 27 European Union countries between 1992 and 2015, we identify, by means of an “hybrid” narrative approach, 68 episodes of promised fiscal expansions. We show that expansionary promise gaps were sizeable (about 1.5–2.5% of GDP during an average fiscal expansion episode) and that initial and economic conditions matter in explaining their size. We also find that the more leftist a government is, the larger the expansionary promise gap. Governments facing weak opposition in the parliament and those more effective are characterized by smaller expansionary promise gaps. Regarding the importance of decentralization and the role played by subnational governments, the larger their capacity to influence national legislation and policy, the larger the promise gaps."
879,10152021031374,"Human herpesviruses are a ubiquitous family of viruses that infect individuals of all ages and are present at a high prevalence worldwide. Herpesviruses are responsible for a broad spectrum of diseases, ranging from skin and mucosal lesions to blindness and life-threatening encephalitis, and some of them, such as Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), are known to be oncogenic. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that some herpesviruses may be associated with developing neurodegenerative diseases. These viruses can establish lifelong infections in the host and remain in a latent state with periodic reactivations. To achieve infection and yield new infectious viral particles, these viruses require and interact with molecular host determinants for supporting their replication and spread. Important sets of cellular factors involved in the lifecycle of herpesviruses are those participating in intracellular membrane trafficking pathways, as well as autophagic-based organelle recycling processes. These cellular processes are required by these viruses for cell entry and exit steps. Here, we review and discuss recent findings related to how herpesviruses exploit vesicular trafficking and autophagy components by using both host and viral gene products to promote the import and export of infectious viral particles from and to the extracellular environment. Understanding how herpesviruses modulate autophagy, endolysosomal and secretory pathways, as well as other prominent trafficking vesicles within the cell, could enable the engineering of novel antiviral therapies to treat these viruses and counteract their negative health effects."
880,101320210112766,"Background To protect vulnerable groups from COVID-19 infection it is important to better understand the risk factors associated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. In this study, we identified factors that increase the risk of hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality in inner North East London (NEL)- a diverse area that experienced some of the highest COVID-19 mortality rates, during the first COVID-19 wave, in the UK. Methods We used multivariate logistic regression analysis on a linked primary and secondary care data from people aged 16 or older (registered with a GP practice in inner NEL) with confirmed COVID-19 infection between 1 February 2020 and 30 June 2020. We determined odds ratios (OR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and p-values for the association between demographic, deprivation and clinical factors with COVID-19 hospitalisation, ICU admission and mortality. Findings Over the study period 1,781 people were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 1,195 (67%) were hospitalised, 152 (9%) admitted to ICU and 400 (23%) died. Results confirm previously identified risk factors: being male, or of Black or Asian ethnicity, or aged over 50. Obesity, type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) increased the risk of hospitalisation while obesity increased the risk of being admitted to ICU and underlying CKD, stroke and dementia increased the risk of death. Importantly, we identified that having learning disabilities was strongly associated with increased risk of death (OR=4.75, 95%CI=(1.91,11.84), p=0.001). Additionally, having three or four co-morbidities increased the risk of hospitalisation (OR=2.34,95%CI=(1.55,3.54),p<0.001 and OR=2.40, 95%CI=(1.55,3.73), p<0.001 respec-tively) and death (OR=2.61, 95%CI=(1.59,4.28), p<0.001 and OR=4.07, 95% CI= (2.48,6.69), p<0.001 respectively). Interpretation Our findings confirm that age, sex, ethnicity, obesity, CKD and diabetes are important determinants of risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation or death. For the first time, we also identify additional patient cohorts that need to be actively protected in the current and subsequent COVID-19 waves, including people with learning disabilities and multi-morbidity."

Healthcare professionals have been infected with the virulent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS), which spreads by close contact and aerosols. The anesthesiologist is particularly vulnerable to aerosols while performing intubation and other airway related procedures. Regional anesthesia (RA) minimizes the need for airway manipulation and the risks of cross infection to other patients, and the healthcare personnel. In this context, for prioritizing RA over general anesthesia, wherever possible, a structured algorithmic approach is outlined. The role of percentage saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen (oxygen saturation), blood pressure and early use of point-of-care ultrasound in differential diagnosis and specific management is detailed. The perioperative anesthetic implications of multisystem manifestations of COVID-19, anesthetic management options, the scope of RA and considerations for its safe conduct in operating rooms is described. An outline for safe and rapid training of healthcare personnel, with an Entrustable Professional Activity framework for ascertaining the practice readiness among trained residents for RA in COVID-19, is suggested. These are the authors’ experiences gained from the current pandemic and similar SARS, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and influenza outbreaks in recent past faced by our authors in Singapore, India, Hong Kong and Canada."

The rise of populism, and the differing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic between nations, has been drawing attention to wider implications of pervasive distrust, including distrust of the media. In this article, I develop three propositions. First, I identify trust studies as a rich interdisciplinary field, linking communication to other branches of the social sciences and humanities. Second, I argue that we lack a comprehensive account of how trust has been understood in communication, and that doing so requires integrating macro-societal approaches with the “meso” level of institutions, and the “micro” level of interpersonal communication. Third, I propose that a focus upon trust would open up new perspectives on two important topics—the future of news media and journalism, and the global rise of populism."

The aim of this review article is to describe the various processes implemented by a radiology department in an educational institution in a resource limited country during the COVID-19 crisis, giving insights into the adopted strategies in other institutions in developed countries. MAIN BODY: Our preparedness strategy was directed into five main domains: protection and wellness of radiology faculty and staff, radiological examinations and patients’ safety, education, research, and financial support. By implementing new strategies, we found that work reorganization through the use of home PACS provided safe and effective reporting service, low infection rate with zero mortality, and online lectures and theses defense were successful. Furthermore, governmental support and donations were helpful in facing financial challenges during the pandemic. A comprehensive literature review search for policies adopted by other radiology departments in the world was performed. The adopted strategies of various centers are generally similar to ours aiming for mitigating the spread of the virus, keeping good patients’ care, and maintaining the educational process. Few policy differences across institutions were found in the reporting strategy of COVID-19 pneumonia and according to the availability of resources. CONCLUSION: Covid-19 pandemic has opened the door for changes in the radiology department policies with renewed focus on educational, clinical, and scientific strategies. Documentation of the dynamic modifications of everyday practices and lessons learned are important as a reference for preparedness for possible second surge or future crisis."

In response to this pandemic, a global mobilization of scientific, industrial and political support has ensued. However, more than 8 months later, as studies multiply and several governments are embarking on a resumption of their activities, the threat still remains. Our efforts to understand the evolution of the virus and the means to defeat it, at the dawn of a possible new wave, have raised more questions than provided clear and unequivocal answers. Compared to diseases caused by previously known human coronavirus, COVID-19 shows higher transmissibility, as a matter of fact “deeply concerning” cases continue to increase. Under these circumstances, and based on the information we have collected so far, this paper provides an overview of the epidemiological status of COVID-19 by considering, first through comparisons with other coronaviruses, similarities that may guide prevention measures and potentially effective therapies. From this starting point, we aimed to discuss the evidence around the efficacy of masks and respirators for different group of the population. Finally, we address therapeutic aspects including perspectives of vaccines and some antimicrobial agents such as remdesivir, favipiravir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin and immunomodulators."
888,101520210311401,"Nation-wide community quarantines and social distancing are part of the new normal because of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Since extensive and prolonged lockdowns are relatively novel experiences, not much is known about the well-being of individuals in such extreme situations. This research effort investigated the relationship between well-being elements and resiliency of 533 Filipino adults who were placed under the nationwide enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants comprised of 376 females (70.56%) and 157 males (29.45%). The median and mode ages of the participants is 23 years, while 25 is the mean age. PERMA Profiler was used to measure participants’ well-being elements, while Connor-Davidson Resiliency Scale-10 (CD-RISC-10) was used to measure their resiliency. Collected data were analyzed using the regression model and necessary condition analysis. This study corroborated that all the five pillars of well-being are significant positive correlates of resiliency (p < 0.00) in quarantined adults. The results shown accomplishment (β = 0.447, p < 0.01) positively predicts resiliency, while negative emotions (β = −0.171, p < 0.00) negatively predict resiliency. Lastly, the five pillars of well-being are necessary-but-not-sufficient conditions (ceiling envelopment with free disposal hull, CE-FDH p < 0.00) of resiliency. Our results cast a new light on well-being elements as constraints rather than enablers of resiliency. This novel result shows that optimum resiliency is only possible when all the five pillars of well-being are taken care of and when a person is at least minimally contented with their physical health. The present findings underscore the importance of a holistic as against an atomistic approach to maintaining good mental health, which suggests that deficiencies in certain areas of well-being may not be fully addressed by overcompensating on other areas, as all five pillars of well-being are necessary-but-not-sufficient conditions of resiliency. The study ends with the recommendation for the use of necessary condition analysis to study both classical and novel psychological research problems."
889,10172021054083,"According to preliminary data, seroconversion after mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination might be unsatisfactory in Kidney Transplant Recipients (KTRs). However, it is unknown if seronegative patients develop at least a cellular response that could offer a certain grade of protection against SARS-CoV-2. To answer this question, we prospectively studied 148 recipients of either kidney (133) or kidney-pancreas (15) grafts with assessment of IgM/IgG spike (S) antibodies and ELISpot against the nucleocapside (N) and the S protein at baseline and two weeks after receiving the second dose of the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine. At baseline, 31 patients (20.9%) had either IgM/IgG or ELISpot positivity and were considered to be SARS-CoV-2-pre-immunized, while 117 (79.1%) patients had no signs of either cellular or humoral response and were considered SARS-CoV-2-naïve. After vaccination, naïve patients who developed either humoral or cellular response were finally 65.0%, of which 29.9% developed either IgG or IgM and 35.0% S-ELISpot positivity. Factors associated with vaccine unresponsiveness were diabetes and treatment with anti-thymocytes globulins during the last year. Side effects were consistent with that of the pivotal trial and no DSAs developed after vaccination. In conclusion, mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine elicits either cellular or humoral response in almost two thirds of KTRs."
890,10162021047998,"Introduction In addition to being at greater risk for severe illness and fatality during infectious outbreaks, older adults are also vulnerable to mental and physical health risks due to increased social isolation. Studies on the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are rapidly emerging, with reviews focused on the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms in patients infected with COVID-19, healthcare workers, or mixed samples of healthcare workers, patient populations, and community-dwelling individuals. However, recent reviews of mental health during COVID-19 have failed to focus on findings in the geriatric population. This review provides a scope of the current literature on the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms in the general population, with a geriatric lens, by examining older adults' representation across studies and the pandemic's impact on older adults’ mental health. Methods The PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews Checklist was used as the methodological framework to conduct the review. A review of the literature on the topic was conducted through PubMed and https://www.medrxiv.org/ from January 1st, 2020 to June 1st, 2020. Studies were included if they (i) focused on mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic, (ii) used validated measures of psychological or psychiatric symptomatology; (iii) included samples of the general population or in which they comprised the majority; (iv) reported quantitative outcomes of prevalence (expressed as the percentage of participants that exceed the cut-off for normal on the measures). Excluded were (i) opinion papers or commentaries without prevalence data; (ii) studies that reported qualitative data or population means only; (iii) studies with samples of primarily healthcare workers (i.e., the entire or >50% of the sample were healthcare workers), (iv) studies with patient samples such as those with confirmed or probable COVID-19 infection, clinic or hospitalized patients, or pregnant women. Fifty-six full-text articles were included in the review, with 33 published articles and 23 pre-print articles. Results Cross-sectional designs were employed by all 56 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The results pooled across the studies showed that 1 in 3 individuals across all age groups endorses post-traumatic stress symptoms, while approximately 30% experience depression, anxiety, and overall stress. Amongst available data in older adults 60 years of age or older, anxiety rates were comparable to the overall population (30.2%), while the prevalence of depression was higher, with nearly 1 in 3 older adults experiencing clinically significant depression symptoms. Effects of age on mental health outcomes are mixed, with several studies showing that the risk or severity of psychiatric symptoms may be lower in older adults. In contrast, others show the opposite pattern or no effect of age. The current literature on mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic has two important methodological limitations. The first is that the cross-sectional design in all reviewed studies does not permit firm conclusions regarding whether the current reported prevalence rates can be attributed to the onset of the pandemic or whether they represent a change from baseline. A second limitation is that all studies reviewed typically assessed mental health outcomes using self-report measures completed by anonymous responders in online surveys. No studies included follow-up assessments, and none conducted clinical or psychiatric interviews to confirm the presence of clinically significant psychiatric symptomatology or to establish a diagnosis. Self-report measures are used as screening tools in psychological research, but there are limitations to relying on scale scores to establish clinical significance. Conclusions Overall, nearly 1 in 3 individuals have experienced negative effects on mental health during COVID-19, a figure that exceeds rates reported in front-line healthcare workers. Paradoxically, some studies report that older age may be a protective factor against psychiatric symptoms, but this is based on a limited number of studies. Our main recommendations for future research include: (i) the use of longitudinal study designs to permit assessment of change in mental health and to yield more definitive conclusions regarding the impact of the pandemic on mental health, and (ii) ensuring a wider representation of older adults through the use of methods, other than online survey platforms, to assess mental health. More high-quality data is needed to understand the pandemic's effects on the general population's mental health, which can inform public health and social policy decisions aimed at alleviating these burdens during the pandemic.

The funders had no role in the design of the study, analysis, or preparation of the manuscript."
891,10152021039728,"Zoonotic infectious diseases are spread from animals to humans. It is estimated that over 60% of human infectious diseases are zoonotic and 75% of them are emerging zoonoses. The majority of emerging zoonotic infectious diseases are caused by viruses including avian influenza, rabies, Ebola, coronaviruses and orthohantaviruses. Spillover of infection from animals to humans depends on a complex transmission pathway, which is influenced by epidemiological and environmental processes. In this investigation, the focus is on direct transmission between animals and humans and the effects of seasonal variations on the transmission and recovery rates. Fluctuations in transmission and recovery, besides being influenced by physiological processes and behaviors of pathogen and host, are driven by seasonal variations in temperature, humidity or rainfall. A new time-nonhomogeneous stochastic process is formulated for infectious disease spread from animals to humans when transmission and recovery rates are time-periodic. A branching process approximation is applied near the disease-free state to predict the probability of the first spillover event from animals to humans. This probability is a periodic function of the time when infection is introduced into the animal population. It is shown that the highest risk of a spillover depends on a combination of animal to human transmission, animal to animal transmission and animal recovery. The results are applied to a stochastic model for avian influenza with spillover from domestic poultry to humans."

Evans Jr., Ph.D., APA's CEO, said in a statement. “The federal government has just identified psychologists as critical, essential workers in the U.S. response to COVID‐19. But this does not mean that psychologists and psychology trainees must do work in person,” he said. “Essential psychological services can, and in many cases, should be delivered through telehealth. It is critically important that psychologists are able to meet the needs of their patients and communities during this difficult time, without further increasing the risk of contagion.”"
893,100720200713111,"BACKGROUND: The ongoing US MM-6 study is investigating in-class transition (iCT) from parenteral bortezomib-based induction to all-oral ixazomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (ixazomib-Rd) with the aim of increasing proteasome inhibitor (PI)-based treatment adherence/duration while maintaining quality of life (QoL) and improving outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: US community sites are enrolling non-transplant-eligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) patients with no evidence of progressive disease after 3 cycles of bortezomib-based therapy to receive ixazomib-Rd (up to 39 cycles or until progression/toxicity). Patients use mobile/wearable digital devices to collect actigraphy (activity/sleep) data and electronically complete QoL/treatment satisfaction/medication adherence questionnaires. Primary endpoint: progression-free survival (PFS); key secondary endpoints include response rates and therapy duration. RESULTS: At data cutoff, 84 patients had been treated (median age 73 years; 44% ≥ 75 years; 49% male; 15% black/African American; 10% Hispanic/Latino); 62% of patients remain on therapy. Mean duration of total PI therapy was 10.1 months and of ixazomib-Rd was 7.3 months. With 8 months median follow-up, 12-month PFS rate was 86% (95% confidence interval, 73–93) from both the start of bortezomib-based treatment and the start of ixazomib-Rd. Overall response rate was 62% (complete response [CR], 4%; very good partial response [VGPR], 25%; partial response [PR], 33%) after bortezomib-based induction and 70% (CR, 26%; VGPR, 29%; PR, 15%) after iCT. The ixazomib-Rd safety profile was consistent with previous clinical trial data. QoL/treatment satisfaction were maintained. CONCLUSION: US MM-6 patients are representative of the real-world US MM population; iCT may permit prolonged PI-based therapy with promising efficacy, without impacting patients’ QoL/treatment satisfaction."
894,10082020082421,"Despite the importance of dairy farming in Uruguay, little information on dairy systems in this country is available in the scientific literature, and management practices that influence calf welfare at the herd level have not been explored. The aims of this study were to (1) describe the prepartum and calf-rearing systems, as well as the management practices that may influence calf welfare in pastured dairy herds in Uruguay, (2) estimate the annual calf mortality risk from birth to weaning, and (3) identify the primary clinical disease syndromes shown by the calves before death. A survey comprising a farm visit and a questionnaire was conducted on 225 randomly selected dairies with >30 milking cows, in 3 strata (31-99, 100-299, and ≥300 milking cows) of 6 Uruguayan departments where dairies are concentrated. Retrospective information from July 2013 to June 2014 was collected. A descriptive analysis was performed and results were inferred into the national dairy cattle population. Several management practices that could contribute to poor calf welfare were identified in a large proportion of farms. The annual calf mortality risk (calves that died between birth and weaning/calves born death or alive × 100, n = 149 farms) was 15.2%. Age at weaning averaged 75 d. Farmers reported that the most common clinical syndromes were diarrhea and respiratory disease in 85.2% and 47.5% of the farms, respectively. There was no continuous veterinary advice in 61.3% of the farms, 20.0% lacked data records, 38.5% had poor drainage in the prepartum area with waterlogging after rainfall, 52.1% monitored the prepartum area ≤2 times per day during the calving season, 65.1% did not perform navel antisepsis on newborns, 62.3% separated the calves from their dams at >24 h postpartum, 95.2% did not have a colostrum management program, 72.4% did not rotate the calf-rearing areas, 59.0% did not disinfect the calf feeders, 85.7% did not have staff dedicated exclusively to calf rearing, and 39.8% did not separate sick from healthy calves. The average volume of milk or milk replacer offered per calf was 4.5 L/day. Several of the identified management practices that affect calf welfare in the prepartum and calf-rearing periods could explain the high mortality risk. An effort should be made to conduct extension work focusing on the dissemination of good management practices to improve calf welfare and reduce calf mortality in Uruguayan dairy farms."
895,10062020063685,"Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) potently inhibits entry of diverse enveloped viruses by trapping the viral fusion at a hemifusion stage, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that recombinant IFITM3 reconstituted into lipid vesicles induces negative membrane curvature and that this effect maps to its small amphipathic helix (AH). We demonstrate that AH: (i) partitions into lipid-disordered domains where IAV fusion occurs, (ii) induces negative membrane curvature, and (iii) increases lipid order and membrane stiffness. Additionally, replacing the IFITM3 AH with AH from an unrelated protein did not compromise its antiviral activity. These effects on membrane properties correlate with the fusion-inhibitory activity, as exogenous addition of AH to insulin-producing cells reduces glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Our results thus imply that IFITM3 inhibits the transition from hemifusion to full fusion by imposing an unfavorable membrane curvature and increasing the order and stiffness of the cytoplasmic leaflet of endosomal membranes."
896,10122020124285,"Abstract In a human-centered intelligent manufacturing system, every element is to assist the operator in achieving the optimal operational performance. The primary task of developing such a human-centered system is to accurately understand human behavior. In this paper, we propose a fog computing framework for assembly operation recognition, which brings computing power close to the data source in order to achieve real-time recognition. For data collection, the operator's activity is captured using visual cameras from different perspectives. For operation recognition, instead of directly building and training a deep learning model from scratch, which needs a huge amount of data, transfer learning is applied to transfer the learning abilities to our application. A worker assembly operation dataset is established, which at present contains 10 sequential operations in an assembly task of installing a desktop CNC machine. The developed transfer learning model is evaluated on this dataset and achieves a recognition accuracy of 95% in the testing experiments."
897,10112020112295,"Aquatic birds are the main reservoir of influenza A viruses (IAVs). These viruses can infect humans repeatedly and cause acute respiratory disease with potential of spread in the form of epidemics. In addition, avian influenza viruses that overcome the interspecies barrier and adapt to humans can cause a world-wide pandemic with severe consequences to human health. Therefore, scientists are focused on the development of a ""universal"" vaccine with a broad protective efficacy, i.e. against different subtypes of influenza A viruses and not only against the currently co-circulating human epidemic strains. Nowadays, several new vaccine design strategies have been described. Most of them utilize the conserved stem part of influenza surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) or the ectodomain of M2 (M2e) protein with proton- channel activity. A comparison of the effectivity of novel vaccines and their protective mechanisms against influenza infection is discussed in this review and should be considered for the construction of the most effective broadly protective vaccine with minimal side effects. This is the essential goal in influenza virus research today, especially when the infection with new human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 can interfere with the course of influenza virus infection. Keywords: influenza A virus; HA2 gp; M2 ectodomain; universal vaccine."
898,10052020055695,"The ongoing Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has emphasized the urgent need for antiviral therapeutics. The viral RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp) is a promising target with polymerase inhibitors successfully used for the treatment of several viral diseases. Here we show that Favipiravir exerts an antiviral effect as a nucleotide analogue through a combination of chain termination, slowed RNA synthesis and lethal mutagenesis. The SARS-CoV RdRp complex is at least 10-fold more active than any other viral RdRp known. It possesses both unusually high nucleotide incorporation rates and high-error rates allowing facile insertion of Favipiravir into viral RNA, provoking C-to-U and G-to-A transitions in the already low cytosine content SARS-CoV-2 genome. The coronavirus RdRp complex represents an Achilles heel for SARS-CoV, supporting nucleoside analogues as promising candidates for the treatment of COVID-19."
899,10072020079604,"Abstract A new General Attitudes towards Artificial Intelligence Scale (GAAIS) was developed. The scale underwent initial statistical validation via Exploratory Factor Analysis, which identified positive and negative subscales. Both subscales captured emotions in line with their valence. In addition, the positive subscale reflected societal and personal utility, whereas the negative subscale reflected concerns. The scale showed good psychometric indices and convergent and discriminant validity against existing measures. To cross-validate general attitudes with attitudes towards specific instances of AI applications, summaries of tasks accomplished by specific applications of Artificial Intelligence were sourced from newspaper articles. These were rated for comfortableness and perceived capability. Comfortableness with specific applications was a strong predictor of general attitudes as measured by the GAAIS, but perceived capability was a weaker predictor. Participants viewed AI applications involving big data (e.g. astronomy, law, pharmacology) positively, but viewed applications for tasks involving human judgement, (e.g. medical treatment, psychological counselling) negatively. Applications with a strong ethical dimension led to stronger discomfort than their rated capabilities would predict. The survey data suggested that people held mixed views of AI. The initially validated two-factor GAAIS to measure General Attitudes towards Artificial Intelligence is included in the Appendix."

902,10042020040527,"Granger causality for time series states that a cause improves the predictability of its effect. That is, given two time series x and y, we are interested in detecting the causal relations among them considering the previous observations of both time series. Although, most of the algorithms are designed for causal inference among homogeneous processes where only time series from a specific distribution (mostly Gaussian) are given, many applications generate a mixture of various time series from different distributions. We utilize Generalized Linear Models (GLM) to propose a general information-theoretic framework for causal inference on heterogeneous data sets. We regard the challenge of causality detection as a data compression problem employing the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. By balancing the goodness-of-fit and the model complexity we automatically find the causal relations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets confirm the advantages of our algorithm ITGH (for Information-Theoretic Granger causal inference on Heterogeneous data) compared to other algorithms."
903,10072020076537,"Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome caused by a novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 named COVID-19 and declared as a pandemic. This paper reviews the possibility of repurposing angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) antagonists and vitamin D to treat COVID-19. ACE2 protein found on the cell membranes is the target of SARS-CoV-2 for entering into the host cells. Viral spike protein-binding with ACE2 down-regulates it. As ACE2 is known to protect the lung from injuries, SARS-CoV-2-induced ACE2 deficiency may expose patients to lung damage. AT1R antagonists and vitamin D increase the expression of ACE2 independently. Besides, vitamin D suppresses the compensatory increase in renin levels following the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by AT1R antagonists. Therefore, a combination of AT1R antagonists and vitamin D may offer protection against COVID-19 induced lung injury."

905,10162021048473,"Personal protective equipment and adherence to disinfection protocols are essential to prevent nosocomial severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) transmission. Here, we evaluated infection control measures in a prospective longitudinal single-center study at the Vienna General Hospital, the biggest tertiary care center in Austria, with a structurally planned low SARS-CoV-2 exposure. SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were assessed by Abbott ARCHITECT chemiluminescent assay (CLIA) in 599 health care workers (HCWs) at the start of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in early April and two months later. Neutralization assay confirmed CLIA-positive samples. A structured questionnaire was completed at both visits assessing demographic parameters, family situation, travel history, occupational coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exposure, and personal protective equipment handling. At the first visit, 6 of 599 participants (1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. The seroprevalence increased to 1.5% (8/553) at the second visit and did not differ depending on the working environment. Unprotected SARS-CoV-2 exposure (p = 0.003), positively tested family members (p = 0.04), and travel history (p = 0.09) were more frequently reported by positively tested HCWs. Odds for COVID-19 related symptoms were highest for congestion or runny nose (p = 0.002) and altered taste or smell (p < 0.001). In conclusion, prevention strategies proved feasible in reducing the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from patients and among HCWs in a low incidence hospital, not exceeding the one described in the general population."
906,10152021038436,"BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) is based on a combination of clinical symptomatology, compatible chest imaging findings, evidence of Aspergillus infection and exclusion of alternative diagnosis, all occurring for more than 3 months. Recently, a rapid, highly sensitive and specific point-of-care lateral flow device (LFD) has been introduced for the detection of Aspergillus-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)G, especially in resource-limited settings where CPA is underdiagnosed and often misdiagnosed as smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). Therefore, in our setting, where tuberculosis (TB) is endemic, exclusion of PTB is an important first step to the diagnosis of CPA. We used the recently published CPA diagnostic criteria for resource-limited settings to identify patients with CPA in our center. CASE PRESENTATION: Three Ugandan women (45/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative, 53/HIV infected and 18/HIV negative), with a longstanding history of cough, chest pain, weight loss and constitutional symptoms, were clinically and radiologically diagnosed with PTB and empirically treated with an anti-tuberculous regimen despite negative microbiological tests. Repeat sputum Mycobacteria GeneXpert assays were negative for all three patients. On further evaluation, all three patients met the CPA diagnostic criteria with demonstrable thick-walled cavities and fungal balls (aspergilomas) on chest imaging and positive Aspergillus-specific IgG/IgM antibody tests. After CPA diagnosis, anti-TB drugs were safely discontinued for all patients, and they were initiated on capsules of itraconazole 200 mg twice daily with good treatment outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The availability of simple clinical diagnostic criteria for CPA and a LFD have the potential to reduce misdiagnosis of CPA and in turn improve treatment outcomes in resource-limited settings.

Immunization is a confirmed gizmo for governing and even eliminating communicable diseases. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the challenge and status of immunization during COVID-19 and associated factors among children aged 10–23 months south Nation Nationality and People Region Ethiopia. Methods and Materials: community-based mixed quantitative and qualitative cross-sectional study was done in southwest Ethiopia. Data was collected using semi-structured questionnaires and in-depth interviews. After that, the data were edited, coded, and move in into Epi info version 7.2 for data management then transported to SPSS version 25 for analysis. The analyzed data were presented by tables, graphs, figures, and text form. RESULTS: According to this study, the prevalence of incomplete immunization was found to be 809 (62.2%) with (95% CI: 59.5, 64.8). In multivariable analysis waiting time at a health facility (AOR=0.04, 95% CI 0.0001,0.004), education (AOR=5.08,95% CI2.31,11.14), place of delivery (AOR=2.34,95% CI 4.96,6.089), fearing of COVID-19 (AOR=3.62,95% CI 1.72,7.64) and do not understand the separation care of COVID-19 and other health services (AOR=2.85,95% CI1.38,5.9) were significantly associated factors. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of incomplete immunization among children aged 10–23 months was very high in this study as compared to the other studies done in a different pocket of Ethiopia. Consecutively, reducing waiting time at a health facility, avoiding unnecessary fear of COVID-19, and promoting immunization in a different area of southwest Ethiopia along with health extension workers are recommended."
909,10162021047740,"At the time of writing of this article, there have been over 110 million cases and 2.4 million deaths worldwide since the start of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, postponing millions of non-urgent surgeries. Existing literature explores the complexities of rationing medical care. However, implications of non-urgent surgery postponement during the COVID-19 pandemic have not yet been analyzed within the context of the four pillars of medical ethics. The objective of this review is to discuss the ethics of elective surgery cancellation during the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, and autonomy. This review hypothesizes that a more equitable decision-making algorithm can be formulated by analyzing the ethical dilemmas of elective surgical care during the pandemic through the lens of these four pillars. This paper’s analysis shows that non-urgent surgeries treat conditions that can become urgent if left untreated. Postponement of these surgeries can cause cumulative harm downstream. An improved algorithm can address these issues of beneficence by weighing local pandemic stressors within predictive algorithms to appropriately increase surgeries. Additionally, the potential harms of performing non-urgent surgeries extend beyond the patient. Non-maleficence is maintained through using enhanced screening protocols and modifying surgical techniques to reduce risks to patients and clinicians. This model proposes a system to transfer patients from areas of high to low burden, addressing the challenge of justice by considering facility burden rather than value judgments concerning the nature of a particular surgery, such as cosmetic surgeries. Autonomy can be respected by giving patients the option to cancel or postpone non-urgent surgeries. However, in the context of limited resources in a global pandemic, autonomy is not absolute. Non-urgent surgeries can ethically be postponed in opposition to the patient’s preference. The proposed algorithm attempts to uphold the four principles of medical ethics in rationing non-urgent surgical care by building upon existing decision models, using additional measures of resource burden and surgical safety to increase health care access and decrease long-term harm as much as possible. The next global health crisis will undoubtedly present its own unique challenges. This model may serve as a comprehensive starting point in determining future guidelines for non-urgent surgical care."
910,10072020077629,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a recently emerged lower respiratory tract illness, has quickly become a pandemic. The purpose of this review is to discuss and differentiate COVID-19 typical imaging findings from other diseases, which can appear similar in the first instance. The typical CT findings of COVID-19 are bilateral and peripheral predominant ground glass opacities. As per the Fleischner Society consensus statement, CT is appropriate in certain scenarios, including patients who are at risk for and/or develop clinical worsening. The probability, that CT findings represent COVID-19, however, depends largely on the pre-test probability of infection, which is in turn defined by community prevalence of infection. When the community prevalence of COVID-19 is low, a large gap exists between positive predictive values of chest CT vs. RT-PCR. This implies that with usage of Chest CT there are a large number of false positive results. Imaging differentiation is important, for management and isolation purposes, and for appropriate disposition of CT false positive patients. We will discuss differential pathology with close imaging resemblance to typical CT imaging features of COVID-19, and, highlight CT features that may help in differentiation from other conditions."

912,10102020106239,"Background: Governments across the globe responded with different strategies to the COVID-19 pandemic. While some countries adapted draconic measures, which have been perceived controversial others pursued a strategy aiming for herd immunity. The latter is even more controversial and has been called unethical by the WHO Director-General. Inevitably, without proper control measure, viral diversity increases and multiple infectious exposures become common, when the pandemic reaches its maximum. This harbors not only a potential threat overseen by simplified theoretical arguments in support of herd immunity, but also deserves attention when assessingresponse measures to increasing numbers of infection. Methods and findings: We extend the simulation model underlying the pandemic preparedness web interface CovidSim 1.1 (http://covidsim.eu/) to study the hypothetical effect of increased morbidity and mortality due to 'multi infections', either acquired at by successive infective contacts during the course of one infection or by a single infective contact with a multi-infected individual. The simulations are adjusted to reflect roughly the situation in the East Coast of the USA. We assume a phase of general contact reduction ('lockdown') at the beginning of the epidemic and additional case-isolation measures. We study the hypothetical effects of varying enhancements in morbidity and mortality, different likelihoods of multi-infected individuals to spread multi infections and different susceptibility to multi infectious in different disease phases. It is demonstrated that multi infections lead to a slight reduction in the number of infections, as these are more likely to get isolated due to their higher morbidity. However, the latter substantially increases the number of deaths. Furthermore, simulations indicate that a potential second lockdown can substantially decrease the epidemic peak, the number of multi-infections and deaths. Conclusions: Enhanced morbidity and mortality due to multiple disease exposure is a potential threat in the COVID-19 pandemic that deserves more attention. Particularly it underlines another facet questioning disease management strategies aiming for herd immunity"
913,100920200910826,"BACKGROUND: The CDC protocol for SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR diagnosis (2019-nCoV CDC kit) is considered a gold standard worldwide; based on three different FAM probes (N1 and N2 for viral detection; RP for RNA extraction quality control), three reactions per sample are needed for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. RESULTS: We herein describe a sample pooling protocol: pooling 3 RNA extractions into a single PCR reaction; we tested this protocol with 114 specimens grouped in 38 pools and found no significant differences for N1 and N2 Ct values between pool and single sample PCR reaction. CONCLUSION: This pool of three protocol has a sensitivity of 100 % compared to the standard single sample protocol. For a typical 96-well plate, this pool assay allows 96 samples processing, speeding up diagnosis and reducing cost while maintaining clinical performance, particularly useful for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis at developing countries."
914,101120201110911,"SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a health emergency for occupational healthcare workers at COVID19 hospital wards in Italy. The objective of the study was to investigate if U-Earth AIRcel bioreactors were effective in monitoring and improving air quality via detection, capture, and destruction of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, reducing the risk of transmission among healthcare workers. U-Earth AIRcel bioreactors are a demonstrated effective biomonitoring system. We implemented a methodological approach wherein they were placed at various hospitals treating COVID-19 patients in Italy. The detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was achieved through rapid biomonitoring testing of the solutes from the AIRcel bioreactors via SARS-CoV-2 rapid test antigen and consecutive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis with the multiplex platform (XABT) and the Real-Time PCR Rotor-Gene. The marked presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was found in multiple water samples via the detection of ORF1ab + N and/or E gene involved in gene expression and cellular signaling of the SARS-CoV virus. The AIRcel bioreactors were able to neutralize the virus effectively as traces of the viruses were no longer found in multiple solute samples after an overnight period. Transmission of COVID-19 via bio-aerosols, transmitted by infected patients, remains a viable threat for health workers. AIRcel bioreactors allow for rapid biomonitoring testing for early virus detection within the environment, reducing the risk of exponential contagion exposure and maintaining good air quality without endangering health workers. This same protocol can also be extended to public spaces as a bio-monitoring tool for hotpots early detection."

Several approaches are being used by scientists for investigation, including (1) various small molecule approaches targeting RNA polymerase, 3C-like protease, and RNA endonuclease; and (2) exploration of antibodies obtained from convalescent plasma from patients who have recovered from COVID-19. The coronavirus genome is highly prone to mutations that lead to genetic drift and escape from immune recognition; thus, it is imperative that sub-strains with different mutations are also accounted for during vaccine development. As the disease has grown to become a pandemic, B-cell and T-cell epitopes predicted from SARS coronavirus have been reported. Using the epitope information along with variants of the virus, we have found several variants which might cause drifts. Among such variants, 23403A>G variant (p.D614G) in spike protein B-cell epitope is observed frequently in European countries, such as the Netherlands, Switzerland, and France, but seldom observed in China."

Effects of curcumin and fenugreek soluble fiber on the physical working capacity at the fatigue threshold, peak oxygen consumption, and time to exhaustion. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2020-The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of curcumin in combination with fenugreek soluble fiber (CUR + FEN) or fenugreek soluble fiber alone (FEN) on the neuromuscular fatigue threshold (PWCFT), peak oxygen consumption (V[Combining Dot Above]o2peak), and time to exhaustion (Tlim) on a graded exercise test (GXT), in untrained subjects. The PWCFT estimates the highest power output that can be maintained without evidence of neuromuscular fatigue. Forty-seven untrained, college-aged subjects were randomly assigned to one of 3 supplementation groups; placebo (PLA, n = 15), CUR + FEN (500 mg·d, n = 18), or FEN (300 mg·d, n = 14). The subjects completed a maximal GXT on a cycle ergometer to determine the PWCFT, V[Combining Dot Above]o2peak, and Tlim before (PRE) and after (POST) 28 days of daily supplementation. Surface electromyographic signals were recorded from a bipolar electrode arrangement on the vastus lateralis of the right leg during each test. Separate one-way analysis of covariances were used to determine if there were between-group differences for adjusted POST-PWCFT, POST-V[Combining Dot Above]o2peak, and POST-Tlim values, covaried for the respective PRE-test scores. The adjusted POST-PWCFT for the CUR + FEN group (mean ± SD: 196 ± 58 W) was greater (p = 0.016) than the PLA group (168 ± 49 W) but the FEN group (185 ± 32 W) was not different from the CUR + FEN or PLA groups (p > 0.05). There were no differences for adjusted POST-V[Combining Dot Above]o2peak (p = 0.612) or POST-Tlim (p = 0.508) among the groups. These findings suggested curcumin combined with fenugreek soluble fiber might delay neuromuscular fatigue."
917,10142021023971,"BACKGROUND The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) crisis has affected how hospitals work and has had an effect on orthopedic surgery. OBJECTIVES To compare patient management and low-energy and high-energy trauma treatment at two orthopedic trauma units during the COVID-19 crisis and to clarify resource demands and preparedness in orthopedic clinics during the state of emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS This retrospective study was conducted at two orthopedic trauma units from 14 March 2019 to 14 April 2019 and from 14 March 2020 to 14 April 2020. RESULTS The proportion of patients admitted in the multi-trauma orthopedic unit decreased by one-third, the mean time interval from admission to surgery significantly decreased, and the number of surgeries and mean length of stay in hospital decreased in 2020 compared to the same test period in 2019. In the orthopedic trauma unit, the number of patients and surgeries also decreased. CONCLUSIONS Our study highlights changes in orthopedic injury characteristics in two orthopedic units during the COVID-19 crisis in Latvia and compares these changes to data from the same time period one year earlier."
918,10072020070146,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To compare visual and refractive outcomes of monofocal intraocular lenses (IOLs) with limbal relaxing incisions (LRI) with ‘off-the-shelf’ use of toric IOLs (TIOLs), with a fixed 2-dioptre cylinder (DC) correction, for cataract patients with pre-existing corneal astigmatism in a public-sector setting. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Seventy-seven patients (77 eyes, first treated eye) with visually significant cataract and pre-operative corneal astigmatism ≥2.00 DC were randomised to receive either ‘off-the-shelf’ TIOLs, with a fixed 2.00 DC cylinder correction (39 eyes), or monofocal IOLs (38 eyes) with LRIs. The concept of fixing the cylindrical correction was to minimise costs, allow a full TIOL bank to be available and eliminate the need for individual TIOL ordering. Outcome measures were uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) and refraction. Astigmatic changes were evaluated using the Alpins vector method. RESULTS: Mean UDVA improved from logMAR 0.88 (SD 0.56)[~20/150] pre-operatively to 0.18 (SD 0.19)[~20/30] post-operatively in TIOL group, versus 0.82 (SD 0.55)[~20/130] to 0.27 (SD 0.15)[~20/40] in monofocal/LRI group (P = 0.02; 95% CI: −0.17, −0.01). Mean CDVA improved from logMAR 0.40 (SD 0.26)[~20/50] to 0.01 (SD 0.12)[~20/20] in TIOL group, and 0.41 (SD 0.38)[~20/40] to 0.06 (SD 0.12)[~20/25] in LRI group (P = 0.07; 95% CI: −0.11, 0.01). Average post-operative refractive cylinder in TIOL group was 1.35 DC (SD 0.84 DC) and in LRI group 1.91 DC (SD 1.07 DC) (P = 0.01; 95% CI: −1, −0.12). Mean difference vector magnitude was 1.92 DC (SD 1.08 DC) in LRI group and 1.37 DC (SD 0.84 DC) in TIOL group (P = 0.02; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.99). CONCLUSIONS: TIOLs with a fixed 2.00 DC correction during cataract surgery may improve UDVA, reduce post-operative cylinder and result in a more reliable astigmatic correction compared with monofocal IOLs with LRIs."

Despite many observations, the real impact of COVID-19 in the European Union (EU), its underlying factors and their contribution to mortality and morbidity outcomes were never systematically investigated. The aim of the present work is to provide an overview and a meta-analysis of main predictors and of country differences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection-associated mortality rate (MR) in hospitalized patients. Out of 3714 retrieved articles, 87 studies were considered, including 35,486 patients (mean age 60.9 ± 8.2 years) and 5867 deaths. After adjustment for confounders, diabetes mellitus was the best predictors of MR in an age- and sex-dependent manner, followed by chronic pulmonary obstructive diseases and malignancies. In both the US and Europe, MR was higher than that reported in Asia (25[20;29] % and 20[17;23] % vs. 13[10;17]%; both p < 0.02). Among clinical parameters, dyspnea, fatigue and myalgia, along with respiratory rate, emerged as the best predictors of MR. Finally, reduced lymphocyte and platelet count, along with increased D-dimer levels, all significantly contributed to increased mortality. The optimization of glucose profile along with an adequate thrombotic complications preventive strategy must become routine practice in diseased SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.

920,101620210410095,"Tracheostomies are often utilized in critically ill patients on prolonged mechanical ventilation, to enhance respiratory function and facilitate ventilator weaning. Many coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients develop serious respiratory illness requiring ventilator management. In the early phase of this pandemic, the risk of disease spread lead to the development of conservative guidelines which advocated delaying tracheostomy at least two to three weeks from intubation and, preferably, with negative COVID-19 testing. The morbidly obese patient population, however, presents a unique scenario in which early tracheostomy may be beneficial. In this article, we discuss our institution’s current practices along with clinical outcomes with reference to intensive care literature and propose that early tracheotomy in COVID-19 patients should be considered on a case by case basis."
921,10172021053934,"AIM To identify whether COVID-19 vaccines should be administered in pregnant and breastfeeding women by reviewing the guidance and other evidence. METHODS We reviewed the COVID-19 vaccination guidance for pregnant and breastfeeding women published to date and evidence from preclinical experimental and observational clinical studies, and discuss their implications. RESULTS Pregnant women were excluded from the initial phase 3 clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines resulting in limited data on their efficacy and safety during pregnancy and postpartum. As a result, since December 2020, there has been conflicting advice from public health, governmental, and professional authorities on this matter. From the end of 2020 up to now, some consensus guidance has been published with a prevalent precautionary approach on the administration of vaccines in pregnant women, in breastfeeding ones, or for those who are planning a pregnancy (either spontaneously or with assisted technologies). After the first few months of vaccine administration in some countries, more permissiveness seems to prevail, although with inconsistencies. At the moment, the results obtained by preclinical experimental and observational clinical studies suggest that the risks of the maternal COVID-19 outweigh the undocumented and hypothetical risks of the COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy. Also, until two viral vector COVID-19 vaccines were associated with very rare thromboembolic events, all guidance had agreed that all approved COVID-19 vaccines could be administered in pregnancy. Actually, some concern has been expressed. CONCLUSION COVID-19 vaccines administered in pregnancy can reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 and their serious consequences for mothers and their offspring. However, many aspects remain to be clarified."
922,10082020084050,"Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals ferroelectrics provide an unprecedented architectural freedom for the creation of artificial multiferroics and non-volatile electronic devices based on vertical and co-planar heterojunctions of 2D ferroic materials. Nevertheless, controlled microscopic manipulation of ferroelectric domains is still rare in monolayer-thick 2D ferroelectrics with in-plane polarization. Here we report the discovery of robust ferroelectricity with a critical temperature close to 400 K in SnSe monolayer plates grown on graphene, and the demonstration of controlled room temperature ferroelectric domain manipulation by applying appropriate bias voltage pulses to the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). This study shows that STM is a powerful tool for detecting and manipulating the microscopic domain structures in 2D ferroelectric monolayers, which is difficult for conventional approaches such as piezoresponse force microscopy, thus facilitating the hunt for other 2D ferroelectric monolayers with in-plane polarization with important technological applications."
923,10092020099972,"PURPOSE: In 2007 the two senior authors wrote a review on the structure and function of the endothelial glycocalyx layer (Weinbaum in Annu Rev Biomed Eng 9:121–167, 2007). Since then there has been an explosion of interest in this hydrated gel-like structure that coats the luminal surface of endothelial cells that line our vasculature due to its important functions in (A) basic vascular physiology and (B) vascular related diseases. This review will highlight the major advances that have occurred since our 2007 paper. METHODS: A literature search mainly focusing on the role of the glycocalyx in the two major areas described above was performed using electronic databases. RESULTS: In part (A) of this review, the new formulation of the century old Starling principle, now referred to as the Michel–Weinbaum glycoclayx model or revised Starling hypothesis, is described including new subtleties and physiological ramifications. New insights into mechanotransduction and release of nitric oxide due to fluid shear stress sensed by the glycocalyx are elaborated. Major advances in understanding the organization and function of glycocalyx components, and new techniques for measuring both its thickness and spatio-chemical organization based on super resolution, stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) are presented. As discussed in part (B) of this review, it is now recognized that artery wall stiffness associated with hypertension and aging induces glycocalyx degradation, endothelial dysfunction and vascular disease. In addition to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases, the glycocalyx plays an important role in lifestyle related diseases (e.g., diabetes) and cancer. Infectious diseases including sepsis, Dengue, Zika and Corona viruses, and malaria also involve the glycocalyx. Because of increasing recognition of the role of the glycocalyx in a wide range of diseases, there has been a vigorous search for methods to protect the glycocalyx from degradation or to enhance its synthesis in disease environments. CONCLUSION: As we have seen in this review, many important developments in our basic understanding of GCX structure, function and role in diseases have been described since the 2007 paper. The future is wide open for continued GCX research."
924,10162021041325,"Background/Aims The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant disruption to outpatient services, with hospital resources redirected to acute medical and critical care units. Social distancing measures meant that routine face-to-face outpatient appointments needed to be cancelled or reimagined. Telemedicine offered an attractive solution. Telemedicine uses technology to increase access to healthcare and has been used internationally in remote clinical settings, the National Health Service’s ‘111’ as well as in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Methods The University Hospital Lewisham Rheumatology Department organised outpatient review of new and follow-up patients via a consultant-supervised registrar telephone clinic 5 days a week during the first-wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. 278 patients had a telephone consultation with the registrar over a 3-month period (30 March to 30 June 2020): 197 new and 81 follow-up patients. Results Of the 197 new patient referrals: 2% required urgent face-to-face review (new inflammatory arthritis); 31% were provided with future routine clinic appointments and 44% were discharged: 35 patients without the need for any further investigations and 52 patients following subsequent investigations (e.g. phlebotomy and radiology). Patients were provided with management advice, links to online resources and referred to allied health professionals as indicated, e.g. physiotherapy. Patients were effectively discharged following telephone consultation if the history was sufficient to exclude a condition requiring secondary care management and if relevant community investigations were negative (including inflammatory markers and immunology). 62 of the 197 newly referred patients were offered a routine follow-up appointment. 36 of these patients were reviewed in person when COVID-19 restrictions eased. Of these 36 patients, 20 were subsequently discharged, diagnoses included: chronic pain (5), osteoarthritis (3), mechanical joint pain (6). 11 patients remained for follow up, diagnoses included: Sjögren’s syndrome (2) and palindromic rheumatism (1). 5 patients did not attend. Conclusion The strengths of this model were: the ability to continue to provide an outpatient rheumatology service; provide safe and effective management for new and follow-up patients; provide patient specific advice pertaining to COVID-19 and to support patients and primary care clinicians. The weaknesses of this model were the use of a single practitioner. Video consultation was not available when this model was implemented, but should add further to subsequent services. Our experience with the tele-rheumatology model suggests that a telephone triage system, coupled with relevant investigations prior to referral could lead to an effective virtual management strategy with potential beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. It also has great promise with regards to managing chronic conditions in clinical remission with video or telephone consultations, utilising virtual disease activity scores (ePROMS now available via the BSR) and satellite monitoring of blood tests and urinalysis. As technology continues to advance, we should explore ways to modernise the outpatient services. Disclosure S. Patel: None. P. Lutalo: None. G. Yanni: None. L. Pollard: None."

926,101420210210323,"ObjectivesThis study examined the natural history, including incidence and prevalence, of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies serially up to 6 months post infection in Irish Healthcare Workers (HCWs) at an academic tertiary maternity hospital, during the first pandemic peak from March to September 2020. DesignThis single centre observational study profiled SARS-CoV-2 incidence and infection using viral RNA detected using oro/nasopharyngeal swabs accompanied by serological assessment of study participants for the presence of S SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Participant demographics were also collected alongside information on clinical symptoms and time to recovery. Real time polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) for viral RNA SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed using the Allplex SARS-CoV-2 three gene target 2019-nCoV assay (SeeGene Inc., Rep. of Korea) or the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay on the GeneXpert platform (Cepheid, USA). Blood samples were obtained at the time of initial swab and at up to 4 time points thereafter, for the serological assessment of antibodies against both the spike and nucleocapsid protein antigens of SARS-CoV-2. Serological response was measured using the Captia Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (IgG) ELISA (Trinity Biotech) as part of a clinical performance evaluation. Two other testing methods were also used; the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG) assay (EuroImmun) and the Abbott Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG 75 kit on the Architect i2000SR instrument (Abbott Laboratories). SettingAcademic Tertiary Maternity Hospital in Dublin, Ireland. ParticipantsWe invited symptomatic and asymptomatic healthcare workers employed at the Rotunda Maternity Hospital to participate in the CAST study. Main Outcome MeasuresThe CAST study aimed to examine incidence and clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs and to determine the presence and longevity of antibodies in this group. We also sought to examine the clinical utility of the Captia Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (IgG) ELISA (Trinity Biotech) and to compare it to the current ""accepted"" gold standard platform in Ireland. ResultsBy July 2020, 398 molecular tests had been completed on symptomatic staff with clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this cohort, 14% (n=54/398) had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected by RT-PCR. The CAST study enrolled 137 HCWs with 86 participants symptomatic at time of swab collection and a further 51 asymptomatic control participants. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 52% (n=45/86) symptomatic study participants and serological positivity was confirmed in 98% (n=44/45) of those participants. Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 RNA infection was detected in 4% (n=2/51) of control participants with a seropositivity rate in this group of 8% (n=4/51). We demonstrated that 95% of SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive participants have detectable levels of antibodies at 100 days post infection, which persisted in 91% of participants at day 160+. Ongoing symptoms up to six months post infection were present in 50% of study participants with positive PCR and serology results. These data will be important to consider for long-term workforce planning in a healthcare setting, as the ongoing pandemic continues. FundingThe CAST study was supported by the Rotunda Hospital and Trinity Biotech."
927,101320210112772,"Background: The effect of socioeconomic factors, ethnicity, and other variables, on the frequency of COVID-19 cases [morbidity] and induced deaths [mortality] at sub-population, rather than at individual levels, is only partially understood. Objective: To determine which county-level features best predict COVID-19 morbidity and mortality for a given county in the U.S. Design: A Machine-Learning model that predicts COVID-19 mortality and morbidity using county-level features, followed by a SHAP-values-based importance analysis of the predictive features. Setting: Publicly available data from various American government and news websites. Participants: 3,071 U.S. counties, from which 53 county-level features, as well as morbidity and mortality numbers, were collected. Measurements: For each county: Ethnicity, socioeconomic factors, educational attainment, mask usage, population density, age distribution, COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, air quality indicators, presidential election results, ICU beds. Results: A Random Forest classifier produced an AUROC of 0.863 for morbidity prediction and an AUROC of 0.812 for mortality prediction. A SHAP-values-based analysis indicated that poverty rate, obesity rate, mean commute time to work, and proportion of people that wear masks significantly affected morbidity rates, while ethnicity, median income, poverty rate, and education levels, heavily influenced mortality rates. The correlation between several of these factors and COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, from 4/2020 to 11/2020 shifted, probably due to COVID-19 being initially associated with more urbanized areas, then with less urbanized ones. Limitations: Data are still coming in. Conclusions: Ethnicity, education, and economic disparity measures are major factors in predicting the COVID-19 mortality rate in a county. Between-counties low-variance factors (e.g., age), are not meaningful predictors. Differing correlations can be explained by the COVID-19 spread from metropolitan to less metropolitan areas."
928,10152021031360,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Routinely collected data on the performance of dairy cows are a valuable source of information on the beginning, course, and completion of their productive life. As a result, when using sufficiently accurate methods, one can analyze and optimize the milk production process at a herd level from the breeding and economic point-of-view. In this context, it is important to have a possibility to early predict culling reasons for cows, since, in the case of finding an effective method, it would be possible to modify breeding actions and farm management practices without anticipating the end of the animals’ productive lives. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to verify whether artificial neural networks and a general discriminant analysis may be an effective tool for predicting the culling reasons in cows based on routinely collected first-lactation data. It turned out that they were most effective in predicting culling due to old age and reproductive problems. It is significant because infertility is one of the conditions that are the most difficult to eliminate in dairy herds. ABSTRACT: The aim of the present study was to verify whether artificial neural networks (ANN) may be an effective tool for predicting the culling reasons in cows based on routinely collected first-lactation records. Data on Holstein-Friesian cows culled in Poland between 2017 and 2018 were used in the present study. A general discriminant analysis (GDA) was applied as a reference method for ANN. Considering all predictive performance measures, ANN were the most effective in predicting the culling of cows due to old age (99.76–99.88% of correctly classified cases). In addition, a very high correct classification rate (99.24–99.98%) was obtained for culling the animals due to reproductive problems. It is significant because infertility is one of the conditions that are the most difficult to eliminate in dairy herds. The correct classification rate for individual culling reasons obtained with GDA (0.00–97.63%) was, in general, lower than that for multilayer perceptrons (MLP). The obtained results indicated that, in order to effectively predict the previously mentioned culling reasons, the following first-lactation parameters should be used: calving age, calving difficulty, and the characteristics of the lactation curve based on Wood’s model parameters."
929,10172021054097,"Influenza viruses are responsible for several pandemics and seasonal epidemics and pose a major public health threat. Even after a major outbreak, the emergence of drug-resistant influenza viruses can pose disease control problems. Here we report a novel 6E3 monoclonal antibody capable of recognizing and binding to the H275Y neuraminidase (NA) mutation, which has been associated with reduced susceptibility of influenza viruses to NA inhibitors. The 6E3 antibody had a KD of 72.74 μM for wild-type NA and 32.76 pM for H275Y NA, suggesting that it can identify drug-resistant pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) influenza virus. Molecular modeling studies also suggest the high-affinity binding of this antibody to pH1N1 H275Y NA. This antibody was also subject to dot-blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, bare-eye detection, and lateral flow assay to demonstrate its specificity to drug-resistant pH1N1. Furthermore, it was immobilized on Au nanoplate and nanoparticles, enabling surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based detection of the H275Y mutant pH1N1. Using 6E3 antibody-mediated SERS immunoassay, the drug-resistant influenza virus can be detected at a low concentration of 102 plaque-forming units/mL. We also detected pH1N1 in human nasopharyngeal aspirate samples, suggesting that the 6E3-mediated SERS assay has the potential for diagnostic application. We anticipate that this newly developed antibody and SERS-based immunoassay will contribute to the diagnosis of drug-resistant influenza viruses and improve treatment strategies for influenza patients."
930,101520210311415,"Introduction: To mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent overwhelming the healthcare system, social-distancing policies such as school closure, stay-at-home orders, and indoor dining closure have been utilized worldwide. These policies function by reducing the rate of close contact within populations and results in decreased human mobility. Adherence to social distancing can substantially reduce disease spread. Thus, quantifying human mobility and social-distancing compliance, especially at high temporal resolution, can provide great insight into the impact of social distancing policies. Methods: We used the movement of individuals around New York City (NYC), measured via traffic levels, as a proxy for human mobility and the impact of social-distancing policies (i.e., work from home policies, school closure, indoor dining closure etc.). By data mining Google traffic in real-time, and applying image processing, we derived high resolution time series of traffic in NYC. We used time series decomposition and generalized additive models to quantify changes in rush hour/non-rush hour, and weekday/weekend traffic, pre-pandemic and following the roll-out of multiple social distancing interventions. Results: Mobility decreased sharply on March 14, 2020 following declaration of the pandemic. However, levels began rebounding by approximately April 13, almost 2 months before stay-at-home orders were lifted, indicating premature increase in mobility, which we term social-distancing fatigue. We also observed large impacts on diurnal traffic congestion, such that the pre-pandemic bi-modal weekday congestion representing morning and evening rush hour was dramatically altered. By September, traffic congestion rebounded to approximately 75% of pre-pandemic levels. Conclusion: Using crowd-sourced traffic congestion data, we described changes in mobility in Manhattan, NYC, during the COVID-19 pandemic. These data can be used to inform human mobility changes during the current pandemic, in planning for responses to future pandemics, and in understanding the potential impact of large-scale traffic interventions such as congestion pricing policies."
931,10132021014908,"We selected SARS-CoV2 specific single domain antibodies (sdAbs) from a previously constructed phage display library using synthetic immunogenic peptides of the virus spike (S) protein as bait. The sdAbs targeting the cleavage site (CS) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) in S protein efficiently neutralised the infectivity of a pseudovirus expressing SARS-CoV2 S protein. Anti-CS sdAb blocked the virus infectivity by inhibiting proteolytic processing of SARS-CoV2 S protein. Both the sdAbs retained characteristic structure within the pH range of 2 to 12 and remained stable upto 65°C. Furthermore, structural disruptions induced by a high temperature in both the sdAbs were largely reversed upon their gradual cooling and the resulting products neutralised the reporter virus. Our results therefore suggest that targeting CS in addition to the RBD of S protein by sdAbs could serve as a viable option to reduce SARS-CoV2 infectivity and that proteolytic processing of the viral S protein is critical for infection."
932,10102020108200,"The use of imaging data has been reported to be useful for rapid diagnosis of COVID-19. Although computed tomography (CT) scans show a variety of signs caused by the viral infection, given a large amount of images, these visual features are difficult and can take a long time to be recognized by radiologists. Artificial intelligence methods for automated classification of COVID-19 on CT scans have been found to be very promising. However, current investigation of pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for COVID-19 diagnosis using CT data is limited. This study presents an investigation on 16 pretrained CNNs for classification of COVID-19 using a large public database of CT scans collected from COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 subjects. The results show that, using only 6 epochs for training, the CNNs achieved very high performance on the classification task. Among the 16 CNNs, DenseNet-201, which is the deepest net, is the best in terms of accuracy, balance between sensitivity and specificity, [Formula: see text] score, and area under curve. Furthermore, the implementation of transfer learning with the direct input of whole image slices and without the use of data augmentation provided better classification rates than the use of data augmentation. Such a finding alleviates the task of data augmentation and manual extraction of regions of interest on CT images, which are adopted by current implementation of deep-learning models for COVID-19 classification."
933,10072020079610,"We report the experience of prone ventilation in selected patients treated with helmet non-invasive ventilation (NIV) continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for acute respiratory failure in COVID-19 pneumonia.

No variation of the lung ultrasound pattern before and after prone ventilation has been detected. At the time of writing, we attempted proning with helmet NIV CPAP in 10 patients. In 4 out of 10 patients, the attempt failed due to lack of compliance of the patient, scarce pain control even with ongoing treatment and refusal by the patient to prone positioning."
934,10162021049779,"There is a worldwide need for reagents to perform SARS-CoV-2 detection. Some laboratories have implemented kit-free protocols, but many others do not have the capacity to develop these and/or perform manual processing. We provide multiple workflows for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection in clinical samples by comparing several commercially available RNA extraction methods: QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAgen), RNAdvance Blood/Viral (Beckman) and Mag-Bind Viral DNA/RNA 96 Kit (Omega Bio-tek). We also compared One-step RT-qPCR reagents: TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (FastVirus, ThermoFisher Scientific), qPCRBIO Probe 1-Step Go Lo-ROX (PCR Biosystems) and Luna(®) Universal Probe One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (Luna, NEB). We used primer-probes that detect viral N (EUA CDC) and RdRP (PHE guidelines). All RNA extraction methods provided similar results. FastVirus and Luna proved most sensitive. N detection was more reliable than that of RdRP, particularly in samples with low viral titres. Importantly, we demonstrate that treatment of nasopharyngeal swabs with 70 degrees for 10 or 30 min, or 90 degrees for 10 or 30 min (both original variant and B 1.1.7) inactivates SARS-CoV-2 employing plaque assays, and that it has minimal impact on the sensitivity of the qPCR in clinical samples. These findings make SARS-CoV-2 testing portable to settings that do not have CL-3 facilities. In summary, we provide several testing pipelines that can be easily implemented in other laboratories and have made all our protocols and SOPs freely available at https://osf.io/uebvj/."
935,10112020112281,"BACKGROUND Nutrition plays a major part in the growth and well-being of a child and forms the basis of their existence. A global pandemic like COVID19 poses some serious questions and challenges in the minds of practicing pediatricians as what support to offer our children, theirparents and carers-alleviating their anxiety about their child's diet and nutrition, that is critical at this time of crisis. Although the evidence for pediatric nutrition and COVID19 is not strong, this article aims to critically look into pediatric nutrition during COVID19 pandemic and bring the most recent evidence into limelight and making the right choices with pediatric nutrition. METHODS We performed a search on recent literature using the search terms ""Covid19"" + ""Children"" + ""Nutrition"" to analyze the current evidence supporting nutrition as a stimulant for covid19. A review article based on the above search results was written to highlight the importance of nutrition during this pandemic. RESULTS Strong recommendations remain unchanged for breast feeding, healthy complimentary feeding, use of supplemental formula where appropriate, Oral nutritional supplements, Zinc, n-3& n- 6 fatty acids, probiotics all have a certain role to play as a stimulant for Covid19 in children. CONCLUSION Current evidence emphasizes the use of additional nutritional supplements especially in the ""at risk"" groups, low socio-economic status and children with chronic medical problems. Paediatric nutrition should never be overlooked and ""one size does not fit all"" as every child is different and their individual nutritional needs vary. This review points at the importance nutrition as a stimulant to covid19 in the pediatric population."
936,10052020055681,"Coumarins represent well-established structures to introduce fluorescence into tool compounds for biochemical investigations. They are valued for their small size, chemical stability and accessibility as well as their tunable photochemical properties. As components of fluorophore/quencher pairs or FRET donor/acceptor pairs, coumarins have frequently been applied in substrate mapping approaches for serine and cysteine proteases. This review also focuses on the incorporation of coumarins into the side chain of amino acids and the exploitation of the resulting fluorescent amino acids for the positional profiling of protease substrates. The protease-inhibiting properties of certain coumarin derivatives and the utilization of coumarin moieties to assemble activity-based probes for serine and cysteine protease are discussed as well."
937,10062020063691,"Here we present results from a survey on anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in healthy blood donors from a low incidence COVID-19 area (Apulia region, South Eastern Italy). Among 904 subjects tested, only in 9 cases (0.99%) antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were demonstrated. All the 9 seropositive patients were negative for the research of viral RNA by RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal swab. These data, along with those recently reported from other countries, clearly show that we are very far from herd immunity and that the containment measures are at the moment the only realistic instrument we have to slow the spread of the pandemic."
938,10122020124291,"Abstract The manufacturing process for single-point diamond turning germanium (Ge) can be complex when it comes to freeform IR optics. The multi-variant problem requires an operator to understand that the machining input parameters and choice of tooling will dictate the efficiency of generating surfaces with the appropriate tolerances. Ge is a brittle material and exhibits surface fracture when diamond turned. However, with the introduction of a negatively raked tool, surface fracture can be suppressed such that plastic flow of the material is possible. This paper focuses on the application and evaluation of machine learning methods to better assist the prediction of surface roughness parameters in Ge and provides a comparison with a well-understood ductile material, copper (Cu). Preliminary results show that both classic machine learning (ML) methods and artificial neural network (ANN) models offer improved predictive capability when compared with analytical prediction of surface roughness for both materials. Significantly, ML and ANN models were able to perform well for both Ge, a brittle material prone to surface fracture, and the more ductile Cu. ANN models offered the best prediction tool overall with minimal error. From a computational perspective, both ML and ANN models were able to achieve good results with smaller datasets than typical for many ML applications—which is beneficial since diamond turning can be costly."
939,100720200713105,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) epidemic affected blood collection in Guangzhou, China. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This paper included three studies. The observational study reported the trends of blood collection during the epidemic in Guangzhou, China. The cross‐sectional survey investigated factors influencing blood donation during the COVID‐19 epidemic, and a self‐administered questionnaire was given to 1,584 street whole blood donors (SWBDs) who donated during the epidemic. The randomized controlled trial involved 19,491 SWBDs who donated in 2019 but did not donate during the epidemic. Trial participants were randomly assigned to two intervention groups: group 1 completed Questionnaire 1, which contained precautionary measures in response to COVID‐19 and other messages about blood donation during the epidemic; and group 2 completed Questionnaire 2, which did not include this information. A control group did not receive any questionnaire. RESULTS: As measures implemented, the number of blood donors increased accordingly. Both first‐time and repeat SWBDs perceived the same level of blood need and donated blood because it would save lives. SWBDs who completed Questionnaire 1 expressed a greater intention to donate during the epidemic. Enabling blood donors to perceive a higher level of blood need and a lower level of COVID‐19 infection risk related to blood donation mobilized experienced SWBDs to donate within three weeks. Intention‐to‐treat analyses and average‐treatment‐effect‐on‐the‐treated estimations confirmed that Questionnaire 1 could motivate SWBDs to actually donate blood. CONCLUSION: Various measures could ease blood shortage during the COVID‐19 epidemic. Administration of Questionnaire 1 could increase blood donations during the epidemic.

943,10112020114828,"INTRODUCTION: : The presence of COVID-19 infection may increase the risk of thrombotic events including ischemic strokes. Whilst a number of recent reports suggest that COVID-19 associated stroke tends to be severe, there is limited data on the effects of COVID-19 in prospective registries. PATIENT AND METHODS: : To determine how COVID-19 infection may affect cerebrovascular disease, we evaluated the ischemic stroke sub-types, clinical course and outcomes prior to and during the pandemic in Qatar. The Hamad General Hospital (HGH) stroke database was interrogated for stroke admissions during the last 4 months of 2019 and January-May 2020. RESULTS: : In Qatar the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 increased from only 2 in February to 779 in March, 12,628 in April and 45,501 in May. Stroke admissions to HGH declined marginally from an average of 97/month for six pre-COVID months to 72/month in March – May. There were 32 strokes that were positive for COVID-19. When compared to non-COVID-19 stroke during the three months of the pandemic, COVID-19 patients were younger with significantly lower rates of hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia. COVID-19 positive patients had more cortical strokes (34.4% vs 5.6%; p= 0.001), severe disease (NIHSS >10: 34.4% vs 16.7%; p=0.001) prolonged hospitalization and fewer with good recovery (mRS 0-2: 28.1% vs 51.9%; p= 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: : When compared to six pre-COVID-19 months, the number of ischemic stroke admissions during the three months of the pandemic declined marginally. COVID-19 positive patients were more likely to have a large cortical stroke with severe symptoms and poor outcome."
944,10092020097787,"Wildlife vaccination is of urgent interest to reduce disease-induced extinction and zoonotic spillover events. However, several challenges complicate its application to wildlife. For example, vaccines rarely provide perfect immunity. While some protection may seem better than none, imperfect vaccination can present epidemiological, ecological, and evolutionary challenges. While anti-infection and antitransmission vaccines reduce parasite transmission, antidisease vaccines may undermine herd immunity, select for increased virulence, or promote spillover. These imperfections interact with ecological and logistical constraints that are magnified in wildlife, such as poor control and substantial trait variation within and among species. Ultimately, we recommend approaches such as trait-based vaccination, modeling tools, and methods to assess community- and ecosystem-level vaccine safety to address these concerns and bolster wildlife vaccination campaigns."
945,10072020076523,"The most effective way to stem the spread of a pandemic such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is social distancing, but the introduction of such measures is hampered by the fact that a sizeable part of the population fails to see their need. Three studies conducted during the mass spreading of the virus in the United States toward the end of March 2020 show that this results partially from people’s misperception of the virus’s exponential growth in linear terms and that overcoming this bias increases support for social distancing. Study 1 shows that American participants mistakenly perceive the virus’s exponential growth in linear terms (conservatives more so than liberals). Studies 2 and 3 show that instructing people to avoid the exponential growth bias significantly increases perceptions of the virus’s growth and thereby increases support for social distancing. Together, these results show the importance of statistical literacy to recruit support for fighting pandemics such as the coronavirus."
946,10102020107133,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and recombinant ACE2 decoys are being evaluated as new antiviral therapies. We designed and tested an antibody-like ACE2-Fc fusion protein, which has the benefit of long pharmacological half-life and the potential to facilitate immune clearance of the virus. Out of a concern that the intrinsic catalytic activity of ACE2 may unintentionally alter the balance of its hormonal substrates and cause adverse cardiovascular effects in treatment, we performed a mutagenesis screening for inactivating the enzyme. Three mutants, R273A, H378A and E402A, completely lost their enzymatic activity for either surrogate or physiological substrates. All of them remained capable of binding SARS-CoV-2 and could suppress the transduction of a pseudotyped virus in cell culture. This study established new ACE2-Fc candidates as antiviral treatment for SARS-CoV-2 without potentially harmful side effects from ACE2's catalytic actions toward its vasoactive substrates."
947,10042020040533,"Feature engineering usually needs to excavate dense-and-implicit cross features from multi-filed sparse data. Recently, many state-of-the-art models have been proposed to achieve low-order and high-order feature interactions. However, most of them ignore the importance of cross features and fail to suppress the negative impact of useless features. In this paper, a novel multi-scale feature-crossing attention network (MsFcNET) is proposed to extract dense-and-implicit cross features and learn their importance in the different scales. The model adopts the DIA-LSTM units to construct a new attention calibration architecture, which can adaptively adjust the weights of features in the process of feature interactions. On the other hand, it also integrates a multi-scale feature-crossing module to strengthen the representation ability of cross features from multi-field sparse data. The extensive experimental results on three real-world prediction datasets demonstrate that our proposed model yields superior performance compared with the other state-of-the-art models."

949,10152021038422,"BACKGROUND: The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has impacted adversely upon the mental health of millions of people worldwide. Impacts on the mental health conditions and the associated predictors relating to adults in Pakistan, the fifth most populous country in the world, during the COVID-19 remain understudied. Our aim was to investigate distress, anxiety, and overall mental health and their associated predictors among Pakistani adults in this pandemic. We specifically examine mental health issues based on the distance from the epicenter, (a predictor that has revealed opposing evidence in other countries) based on the theories of typhoon eye effect and ripple effect. The sample consisted of 601 adults who were surveyed online about 2.5 months into the outbreak across Pakistan with varying distances from the epicenter of COVID-19 of Karachi. RESULTS: The results showed that 9.2 and 19.0% of the participants surpassed the cut-off criteria for distress and anxiety disorders, respectively. Overall, the distance from the epicenter positively predicted the mental health of adults in Pakistan, and family size negatively moderated this effect. The distance from the epicenter negatively predicted distress and anxiety disorders for adults in large families, which are quite common in Pakistan. CONCLUSION: The evidence of the study interestingly finds that the prediction of the mental health of people by their distance from the epicenter depends on family size. The evidence of this study can help to provide initial indicators for mental health care providers to screen vulnerable groups in Pakistan, a populous country that continues struggling to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic."
950,10162021048467,"The longevity of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, and the devastating effects it has had on certain subsets of individuals thus far has highlighted the importance of identifying blood-based biomarkers associated with disease severity. We employed computational and transcriptome analyses of publicly available datasets from PBMCs from 126 patients with COVID-19 admitted to ICU (n=50), COVID-19 not admitted to ICU (n=50), non-COVID-19 admitted to ICU (n=16) and non-COVID-19 not admitted to ICU (n=10), and utilized the Gencode V33 assembly to analyze protein coding mRNA and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) transcriptomes in the context of disease severity. Our data identified several aberrantly expressed mRNA and lncRNA based biomarkers associated with SARS-CoV-2 severity, which in turn significantly affected canonical, upstream, and disease functions in each group of patients. Immune, interferon, and antiviral responses were severely suppressed in COVID-19 admitted to ICU versus COVID-19 who were not admitted to ICU. Our data suggests a possible therapeutic approach for severe COVID-19 through administration of interferon therapy. Delving further into these biomarkers, roles and their implications on the onset and disease severity of COVID-19 could play a crucial role in patient stratification and identifying varied therapeutic options with diverse clinical implications."
951,10162021047754,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a notable increase in telemedicine adoption. However, the impact of the pandemic on telemedicine use at a population level in rural and remote settings remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate changes in the rate of telemedicine use among rural populations and identify patient characteristics associated with telemedicine use prior to and during the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a repeated cross-sectional study on all monthly and quarterly rural telemedicine visits from January 2012 to June 2020, using administrative data from Ontario, Canada. We compared the changes in telemedicine use among residents of rural and urban regions of Ontario prior to and during the pandemic. RESULTS: Before the pandemic, telemedicine use was steadily low in 2012-2019 for both rural and urban populations but slightly higher overall for rural patients (11 visits per 1000 patients vs 7 visits per 1000 patients in December 2019, P<.001). The rate of telemedicine visits among rural patients significantly increased to 147 visits per 1000 patients in June 2020. A similar but steeper increase (P=.15) was observed among urban patients (220 visits per 1000 urban patients). Telemedicine use increased across all age groups, with the highest rates reported among older adults aged ≥65 years (77 visits per 100 patients in 2020). The proportions of patients with at least 1 telemedicine visit were similar across the adult age groups (n=82,246/290,401, 28.3% for patients aged 18-49 years, n=79,339/290,401, 27.3% for patients aged 50-64 years, and n=80,833/290,401, 27.8% for patients aged 65-79 years), but lower among younger patients <18 years (n=23,699/290,401, 8.2%) and older patients ≥80 years (n=24,284/290,401, 8.4%) in 2020 (P<.001). There were more female users than male users of telemedicine (n=158,643/290,401, 54.6% vs n=131,758/290,401, 45.4%, respectively, in 2020; P<.001). There was a significantly higher proportion of telemedicine users residing in relatively less rural than in more rural regions (n=261,814/290,401, 90.2% vs n=28,587/290,401, 9.8%, respectively, in 2020; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine adoption increased in rural and remote areas during the COVID-19 pandemic, but its use increased in urban and less rural populations. Future studies should investigate the potential barriers to telemedicine use among rural patients and the impact of rural telemedicine on patient health care utilization and outcomes."

953,10152021037711,"To better tackle diseases and sustain healthy ecosystems, One Health programs must efficiently bridge health in humans, domestic/livestock species, wild animals and plants, agriculture/aquaculture, and the environment. The Smithsonian Institution proposes to address this by considering ‘health' in a broad sense – the absence of undue pathogens and unnecessary stress for any organisms as well as access to good living conditions in functional environments. Considering the interconnectedness of all life forms, the Smithsonian plans to create a framework that will integrate cultural, social, and educational components into health research on humans, animals, plants, or ecosystems. The objectives of this perspective article are to (1) propose an innovative framework to support an interconnected/integrated approach to health and (2) provide examples fostering impactful collaborations on One Health research and education. Based on the core strengths of the Smithsonian (multidisciplinary research, outreach and education programs, libraries/archives, and collections) and central institutional support, this framework has the potential to extend existing health-related projects, address new needs and situations (e.g., response to pandemics), provide invaluable resources to inform policy and decision makers, and educate all audiences globally."
954,10172021053920,"Despite over 140 million SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide since the beginning of the pandemic, relatively few confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection have been reported. While immunity from SARS-CoV-2 infection is probable, at least in the short term, few studies have quantified the reinfection risk. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to synthesise the evidence on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection over time. A standardised protocol was employed, based on Cochrane methodology. Electronic databases and preprint servers were searched from 1 January 2020 to 19 February 2021. Eleven large cohort studies were identified that estimated the risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection over time, including three that enrolled healthcare workers and two that enrolled residents and staff of elderly care homes. Across studies, the total number of PCR-positive or antibody-positive participants at baseline was 615,777, and the maximum duration of follow-up was more than 10 months in three studies. Reinfection was an uncommon event (absolute rate 0%-1.1%), with no study reporting an increase in the risk of reinfection over time. Only one study estimated the population-level risk of reinfection based on whole genome sequencing in a subset of patients; the estimated risk was low (0.1% [95% CI: 0.08-0.11%]) with no evidence of waning immunity for up to 7 months following primary infection. These data suggest that naturally acquired SARS-CoV-2 immunity does not wane for at least 10 months post-infection. However, the applicability of these studies to new variants or to vaccine-induced immunity remains uncertain."
955,10062020063849,"Despite dramatic reductions in the rates of bacteremia and meningitis since the 1980s, febrile illness in children younger than 36 months continues to be a concern with potentially serious consequences. Factors that suggest serious infection include age younger than one month, poor arousability, petechial rash, delayed capillary refill, increased respiratory effort, and overall physician assessment. Urinary tract infections are the most common serious bacterial infection in children younger than three years, so evaluation for such infections should be performed in those with unexplained fever. Abnormal white blood cell counts have poor sensitivity for invasive bacterial infections; procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels, when available, are more informative. Chest radiography is rarely recommended for children older than 28 days in the absence of localizing signs. Lumbar puncture is not recommended for children older than three months without localizing signs; it may also be considered for those from one to three months of age with abnormal laboratory test results. Protocols such as Step-by-Step, Laboratory Score, or the Rochester algorithms may be helpful in identifying low-risk patients. Rapid influenza testing and tests for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be of value when those diseases are circulating. When empiric treatment is appropriate, suggested antibiotics include ceftriaxone or cefotaxime for infants one to three months of age and ampicillin with gentamicin or with cefotaxime for neonates. For children three months to three years of age, azithromycin or amoxicillin is recommended if pneumonia is suspected; for urinary infections, suggested antibiotics are cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Choice of antibiotics should reflect local patterns of microbial resistance."
956,10052020055859,"Targeted contact-tracing through mobile phone apps has been proposed as an instrument to help contain the spread of COVID-19 and manage the lifting of nation-wide lockdowns currently in place in USA and Europe. However, there is an ongoing debate on its potential efficacy, especially in the light of region-specific demographics. We built an expanded SIR model of COVID-19 epidemics that accounts for region-specific population densities, and we used it to test the impact of a contact-tracing app in a number of scenarios. Using demographic and mobility data from Italy and Spain, we used the model to simulate scenarios that vary in baseline contact rates, population densities and fraction of app users in the population. Our results show that, in support of efficient isolation of symptomatic cases, app-mediated contact-tracing can improve containment and achieve successful epidemic mitigation even with relatively small fraction of the population using it, and, with increasing penetrance of its adoption, suppression. However, when regional differences in population density are taken into consideration, the epidemic can be significantly harder to contain in higher density areas, highlighting potential limitations of this intervention in specific contexts. This work corroborates previous results in favor of app-mediated contact-tracing as mitigation measure for COVID-19, and draw attention on the importance of region-specific demographic and mobility factors to achieve maximum efficacy in containment policies."
957,101620210410081,"BACKGROUND: Given the scale of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the development of vaccines based on different platforms is essential, particularly in light of emerging viral variants, the absence of information on vaccine-induced immune durability, and potential paediatric use. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of an MF59-adjuvanted subunit vaccine for COVID-19 based on recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein stabilised in a pre-fusion conformation by a novel molecular clamp (spike glycoprotein-clamp [sclamp]). METHODS: We did a phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, block-randomised trial of the sclamp subunit vaccine in a single clinical trial site in Brisbane, QLD, Australia. Healthy adults (aged ≥18 to ≤55 years) who had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, reported no close contact with anyone with active or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and tested negative for pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 immunity were included. Participants were randomly assigned to one of five treatment groups and received two doses via intramuscular injection 28 days apart of either placebo, sclamp vaccine at 5 μg, 15 μg, or 45 μg, or one dose of sclamp vaccine at 45 μg followed by placebo. Participants and study personnel, except the dose administration personnel, were masked to treatment. The primary safety endpoints included solicited local and systemic adverse events in the 7 days after each dose and unsolicited adverse events up to 12 months after dosing. Here, data are reported up until day 57. Primary immunogenicity endpoints were antigen-specific IgG ELISA and SARS-CoV-2 microneutralisation assays assessed at 28 days after each dose. The study is ongoing and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04495933. FINDINGS: Between June 23, 2020, and Aug 17, 2020, of 314 healthy volunteers screened, 120 were randomly assigned (n=24 per group), and 114 (95%) completed the study up to day 57 (mean age 32·5 years [SD 10·4], 65 [54%] male, 55 [46%] female). Severe solicited reactions were infrequent and occurred at similar rates in participants receiving placebo (two [8%] of 24) and the SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine at any dose (three [3%] of 96). Both solicited reactions and unsolicited adverse events occurred at a similar frequency in participants receiving placebo and the SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine. Solicited reactions occurred in 19 (79%) of 24 participants receiving placebo and 86 (90%) of 96 receiving the SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine at any dose. Unsolicited adverse events occurred in seven (29%) of 24 participants receiving placebo and 35 (36%) of 96 participants receiving the SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine at any dose. Vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 sclamp elicited a similar antigen-specific response irrespective of dose: 4 weeks after the initial dose (day 29) with 5 μg dose (geometric mean titre [GMT] 6400, 95% CI 3683–11 122), with 15 μg dose (7492, 4959–11 319), and the two 45 μg dose cohorts (8770, 5526–13 920 in the two-dose 45 μg cohort; 8793, 5570–13 881 in the single-dose 45 μg cohort); 4 weeks after the second dose (day 57) with two 5 μg doses (102 400, 64 857–161 676), with two 15 μg doses (74 725, 51 300–108 847), with two 45 μg doses (79 586, 55 430–114 268), only a single 45 μg dose (4795, 2858–8043). At day 57, 67 (99%) of 68 participants who received two doses of sclamp vaccine at any concentration produced a neutralising immune response, compared with six (25%) of 24 who received a single 45 μg dose and none of 22 who received placebo. Participants receiving two doses of sclamp vaccine elicited similar neutralisation titres, irrespective of dose: two 5 μg doses (GMT 228, 95% CI 146–356), two 15 μg doses (230, 170–312), and two 45 μg doses (239, 187–307). INTERPRETATION: This first-in-human trial shows that a subunit vaccine comprising mammalian cell culture-derived, MF59-adjuvanted, molecular clamp-stabilised recombinant spike protein elicits strong immune responses with a promising safety profile. However, the glycoprotein 41 peptide present in the clamp created HIV diagnostic assay interference, a possible barrier to widespread use highlighting the criticality of potential non-spike directed immunogenicity during vaccine development. Studies are ongoing with alternative molecular clamp trimerisation domains to ameliorate this response.

The types of diseases included pericoronitis (15.83%), apical periodontitis (14.21%), pulpitis (13.40%), periodontitis (12.31%), oral mucosal disease (12.18%), Oral and maxillofacial trauma (10.55%), oral and maxillofacial space infection (8.39%), dental disease in children (5.41%), oral and maxillofacial tumors (2.84%), temporomandibular joint dislocations and disorders (1.76%), and others (3.11%). CONCLUSIONS Under the epidemic situation of the new coronavirus, as one of the high-risk departments, it is of great significance to enhance the clinical emergency skills and ability of emergency treatment, improve patients' oral health awareness, address the diagnosis and treatment of essential diseases, for the improvement the quality of dental medical care and the prevention and control of COVID-19 epidemic."
960,10072020070152,"γδ T cells play uniquely important roles in stress surveillance and immunity for infections and carcinogenesis. Human γδ T cells recognize and kill transformed cells independently of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) restriction, which is an essential feature of conventional αβ T cells. Vγ9Vδ2 γδ T cells, which prevail in the peripheral blood of healthy adults, are activated by microbial or endogenous tumor-derived pyrophosphates by a mechanism dependent on butyrophilin molecules. γδ T cells expressing other T cell receptor variable genes, notably Vδ1, are more abundant in mucosal tissue. In addition to the T cell receptor, γδ T cells usually express activating natural killer (NK) receptors, such as NKp30, NKp44, or NKG2D which binds to stress-inducible surface molecules that are absent on healthy cells but are frequently expressed on malignant cells. Therefore, γδ T cells are endowed with at least two independent recognition systems to sense tumor cells and to initiate anticancer effector mechanisms, including cytokine production and cytotoxicity. In view of their HLA-independent potent antitumor activity, there has been increasing interest in translating the unique potential of γδ T cells into innovative cellular cancer immunotherapies. Here, we discuss recent developments to enhance the efficacy of γδ T cell-based immunotherapy. This includes strategies for in vivo activation and tumor-targeting of γδ T cells, the optimization of in vitro expansion protocols, and the development of gene-modified γδ T cells. It is equally important to consider potential synergisms with other therapeutic strategies, notably checkpoint inhibitors, chemotherapy, or the (local) activation of innate immunity."
961,10042020046142,"The media have featured the antimalarials chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) to treat coronavirus (COVID-19). Political leaders have touted their use and recommended availability to the public. These anti-inflammatory agents have substantial human toxicity with a narrow therapeutic window. CQ and HCQ poisoning cause myocardial depression and profound hypotension due to vasodilation. Bradycardia and ventricular escape rhythms arise from impaired myocardial automaticity and conductivity due to sodium and potassium channel blockade. With cardiotoxicity, ECGs may show widened QRS, atrioventricular heart block and QT interval prolongation. CQ may also cause seizures, often refractory to standard treatment. Of concern is pediatric poisoning, where 1–2 pills of CQ or HCQ can cause serious and potentially fatal toxicity in a toddler. The treatment of CQ/HCQ poisoning includes high-dose intravenous diazepam postulated to have positive ionotropic and antidysrhythmic properties that may antagonize the cardiotoxic effects of CQ. Infusions of epinephrine titrated to treat unstable hypotension, as well as potassium for severe hypokalemia may be required. Current scientific evidence does not support treatment or prophylactic use of these agents for COVID-19 disease. Regulatory and public health authorities recognize that CQ/HCQ may offer little clinical benefit and only add risk requiring further investigation before wider public distribution."

Here, in multiple, large cohorts of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we have studied the intersections between Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), intestinal inflammation and IBD treatment. A striking expression of ACE2 on the small bowel enterocyte brush border supports intestinal infectivity by SARS-CoV-2. Commonly used IBD medications, both biologic and non-biologic, do not significantly impact ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptor expression in the uninflamed intestines. Additionally, we have defined molecular responses to COVID-19 infection that are also enriched in IBD, pointing to shared molecular networks between COVID-19 and IBD. These data generate a novel appreciation of the confluence of COVID-19- and IBD-associated inflammation and provide mechanistic insights supporting further investigation of specific IBD drugs in the treatment of COVID-19."
965,10172021055389,"Objective As a long-standing Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Program hub, the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) developed and implemented a modern research data warehouse (RDW) to efficiently provision electronic patient data for clinical and translational research. Methods Because UPMC is one of the largest health care systems in the US with multiple vendors' electronic health record (EHR) systems, we designed and implemented an RDW named Neptune to serve the specific needs of our CTSA. Neptune uses an atomic design where data is stored at a high level of granularity as represented in source systems. Neptune contains robust patient identity management tailored for research; integrates patient data from multiple sources, including EHRs, health plans, and research studies; and includes knowledge for mapping to standard terminologies. Neptune enables efficient provisioning of data to large analytics-oriented data models and to individual investigators. Results Neptune contains data for more than 5 million patients longitudinally organized as HIPAA Limited Data with dates and includes structured EHR data, clinical documents, health insurance claims, and research data. Neptune is used as a source for patient data for hundreds of IRB-approved research projects by local investigators and for national projects such as the Accrual to Clinical Trials (ACT) network, the All of Us Research Program, and the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network. Discussion The design of Neptune was heavily influenced by the large size of UPMC, the varied data sources, and the rich partnership between the University and the healthcare system. It features several desiderata of an RDW, including robust protected health information management, an extensible information storage model, and binding to standard terminologies at the time of data delivery. It also includes several unique aspects, including the physical warehouse straddling the University of Pittsburgh and UPMC networks and management under a HIPAA Business Associates Agreement."

Objective To investigate ocular manifestations and clinical characteristics of children with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study was conducted at Wuhan Children's Hospital in Wuhan, China. Children with COVID-19 confirmed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease 2 nucleic acid tests of upper respiratory tract specimens between January 26 and March 18, 2020, were included. Main Outcomes and Measures Onset clinical symptoms and duration, ocular symptoms, and needs for medication. Results A total of 216 pediatric patients were included, among whom 134 (62%) were boys, with a median (interquartile range) age of 7.25 (2.6-11.6) years. Based on the exposure history, 193 children (89.4%) had a confirmed (173 [80.1%]) or suspected (20 [9.3%]) family member with COVID-19 infection. The most common symptoms among symptomatic children were fever (81 [37.5%]) and cough (79 [36.6%]). Of 216 children, 93 (43.1%) had no systemic or respiratory symptoms. All children with mild (101 [46.8%]) or moderate (115 [53.2%]) symptoms recovered without reported death. Forty-nine children (22.7%) showed various ocular manifestations, of which 9 had ocular complaints being the initial manifestations of COVID-19. The common ocular manifestations were conjunctival discharge (27 [55.1%]), eye rubbing (19 [38.8%]), and conjunctival congestion (5 [10.2%]). Children with systemic symptoms (29.3% vs 14.0%; difference, 15.3%; 95% CI, 9.8%-20.7%; P = .008) or with cough (31.6% vs 17.5%; difference, 14.1%; 95% CI, 8.0%-20.3%; P = .02) were more likely to develop ocular symptoms. Ocular symptoms were typically mild, and children recovered or improved. Conclusions and Relevance In this cross-sectional study, children hospitalized with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, presented with a series of onset symptoms including fever, cough, and ocular manifestations, such as conjunctival discharge, eye rubbing, and conjunctival congestion. Patients' systemic clinical symptoms or cough were associated with ocular symptoms. Ocular symptoms recovered or improved eventually."
967,10172021056680,"The COVID-19 pandemic has interrupted the education of millions of students across the world. The purpose of this study was to investigate the perceptions regarding the technological instruction and accommodations provided to deaf students in online distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was qualitative in nature and used anonymous, one-to-one semi-structured interviews. In June 2020, we interviewed a convenience sample of deaf students (n = 15) and their instructors (n = 3) and analysed the responses thematically. Upon achieving theme saturation, the thematic structure analysis was finalised. The results revealed five main themes related to deaf students’ experience with online distance learning during COVID-19. The themes are as follows: course content delivered, technology used, delivery method, assessment tools used, and social interactions. Each theme is discussed and compared with the related literature to scientifically encapsulate its suggested dimensions. The interviewed students described their experience of using online technology in both negative and positive terms. Instructors also provided their input to express their experiences during that time. Online distance learning was described as a difficult and challenging experience that lacked efficient communication channels and failed to address the needs of the deaf with respect to the communication medium. The typical course delivery methods were described as challenging, and the lack of social interaction was highlighted as a liability. At the same time, participants acknowledged some ancillary benefits of online distance learning especially that it enhanced their technology skills and their competences in adapting to a new environment."

It is currently FDA approved for Parkinson’s disease, drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms, and influenza. METHODS: The article is the author’s original research hypothesis. RESULTS: Because more people are going to be vaccinated and additional similar vaccines are going to be introduced, we should take into consideration the potential of amantadine to interfere with LNP-mRNA COVID-19 vaccine delivery into the target cells. CONCLUSIONS: A more cautious approach to the patients taking amantadine as far as vaccination utilizing LNP-mRNA platform should be considered."
969,10162021043532,"During the next few months or years, vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection will significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. However, additional measures are needed to protect those who are still not immunized. This is even more important in view of new viral mutations that result in increased transmission rates. We propose that the use of long-standing medicinal solutions based on hypochloric acid (HOCl) and intended for application on wounds may be effective as a gargling solution or nasal irrigation in blocking transmission of the virus. Here, we propose the use of HOCl-containing solutions for blocking the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in combination with other prevention measures. This may constitute another important cornerstone in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic."
970,101420210212534,"Many governments react to the current coronavirus/COVID‐19 pandemic by restricting daily (work) life. On the basis of theories from occupational health, we propose that the duration of the pandemic, its demands (e.g., having to work from home, closing of childcare facilities, job insecurity, work‐privacy conflicts, privacy‐work conflicts) and personal‐ and job‐related resources (co‐worker social support, job autonomy, partner support and corona self‐efficacy) interact in their effect on employee exhaustion. We test the hypotheses with a three‐wave sample of German employees during the pandemic from April to June 2020 (N (w1) = 2900, N (w12) = 1237, N (w123) = 789). Our findings show a curvilinear effect of pandemic duration on working women's exhaustion. The data also show that the introduction and the easing of lockdown measures affect exhaustion, and that women with children who work from home while childcare is unavailable are especially exhausted. Job autonomy and partner support mitigated some of these effects. In sum, women's psychological health was more strongly affected by the pandemic than men's. We discuss implications for occupational health theories and that interventions targeted at mitigating the psychological consequences of the COVID‐19 pandemic should target women specifically."
971,10112020111950,"Home dialysis use as a treatment for end-stage kidney disease varies locally, nationally, and internationally. There is a call to action in the United States to significantly increase access and uptake of home dialysis as the preferred dialysis treatment option. Although most do not object to patient choice in modality selection, the reality is that there are multilevel barriers both obvious and subtle that interfere with expanding home dialysis access. Financial barriers and how payment is structured continue to be key drivers, although new models of care are emerging that include for the first time incentives rather than penalties regarding home dialysis. Resources to support implementation include expert personnel requiring educational training. Policies requiring training curriculum content that is not only specified within nephrology but also for these multidisciplinary providers requisite for successful home dialysis to ensure professional expertise is ready and available, and also to cultivate champions of home modality within the broader nephrology community. Perhaps most importantly, innovation through expanded investment in research is necessary to advance practices, elevate quality, and improve outcomes. Policy in a variety of sectors at local, regional, national, and international levels has the potential to drastically drive expansion and increasing success of home dialysis."
972,101320210110165,"PURPOSE: Medical education has been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic in many countries, with face-to-face lectures replaced by pre-recorded videos. However, surgical skills training cannot be replaced easily by videos, as a high level of tutor–student interaction is required. Thus, we developed a new web-based surgical skill learning session (WSSL). This case–control study evaluates the surgical skills competency of medical students taught by the WSSL. METHODS: This case–control study compares WSSL with face-to-face tutorials. Students were assigned randomly to one of two groups according to the teaching method. Independent blinded assessment was performed by a standardized marking scheme, modified from the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) global rating scale. RESULTS: We recruited 62 final-year medical students into the study, with 33 randomized to the face-to-face teaching group (control group), and 29 to the WSSL group(case group) according to their student number. The baseline demographic characteristics of the two groups were comparable. The mean score at the clinical competency assessment of the control group was 4.8/5 (range 4–5) and that of the case group was 4.7/5 (range 4–5) (p = 1). There were no difficulties with program or hardware installation reported by the WSSL students. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical skills performance was comparable between students who were taught by the WSSL and those taught by conventional face-to-face tutorials."
973,10122020127940,"OBJECTIVE: Guanylate‐binding protein 1 (GBP1) is reported to promote tumor progression and treatment resistance in lung cancer, and presents as a prognostic biomarker in several solid tumors. However, the related research of GBP1 in clinical management of lung adenocarcinoma is still lacking. Therefore, the present study aimed to detect the clinical role of GBP1 in lung adenocarcinoma. METHODS: The clinical data of 221 lung adenocarcinoma patients were retrospectively analyzed, and then, their tumor tissue specimens and paired adjacent tissue specimens were retrieved for GBP1 detection via immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay. RESULTS: GBP1 expression was upregulated in tumor tissues compared with adjacent tissues (P < .001). Moreover, high tumor GBP1 expression was associated with larger tumor size (P = .030), positive lymph node (LYN) metastasis (P = .001), advanced TNM stage (P = .001), and abnormal preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level (P = .026). Furthermore, tumor GBP1 high expression was correlated with reduced disease‐free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), and was of independent value in predicting worse DFS and OS. Additionally, data analysis of 1144 lung cancer patients derived from KMplot database (www.kmplot.com) further verified that GBP1 expression was negatively correlated with OS (P = .009). CONCLUSION: GBP1 correlates with advanced tumor features and worse survival profiles, suggesting its value to be a prognostic biomarker in management of lung adenocarcinoma."

This poses a challenge for both health professionals, for whom wound management is becoming more complex, and for patients, who have to cope with exudate production, malodour and pain. This article summarises understanding of healing in such wounds and how best to meet the challenge of exudate, which is a ubiquitous hallmark of hard-to-heal wounds. The role of superabsorbent dressings is considered, with particular reference to Kliniderm superabsorbent in the management of people with these challenging wounds."
975,10152021034218,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic has a great impact on the eating habits, dietary intake, and purchasing behaviours of students. At this critical moment, there is an urgent need to identify the eating habits of school students, in particular, who live in low-income countries, during the lockdown period. Therefore, the present study aims to identify the influence of COVID-19 on the eating habits, quality and quantity of food intake among school students in the Gaza Strip, Palestine. METHODS A cross-sectional study was carried out among 2398 primary and secondary school students aged 6-18 year old through an online questionnaire which included questions on socio-demographic, eating habits as well as quality and quantity of food intake. Students over the age of 11 years completed the questionnaire on their own, whereas for students under the age of 12 years, the students' guardians were instructed to answer the questionnaire on their behalf. A Wilcoxon Signed-Rank and McNemar tests were applied to perform a comparison between general dietary habits before and during COVID-19. Also, a Wilcoxon Signed Rank test was used to compare the median scores of food quality and quantity before and during the COVID-19 pandemic based on student's sociodemographic. RESULTS During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant increase in eating home-cooked foods (91.6%), avoiding ordering food from outside per week (93.3%) and buying groceries online (7.7%) (p<0.001). There was a marked increase in the students reporting fear about food hygiene outside the home from 20.8% before COVID-19 to 72.9% during the COVID-19 period (p<0.001). The results showed that the median score for food quality during the COVID-19 pandemic (11.0/6.0) was significantly higher than the before COVID-19 period (10.0, IQR=8.0) (p<0.001). the results revealed that the median score for food quantity before the COVID-19 pandemic (15.0, IQR=5.0) was significantly higher than the during COVID-19 pandemic (14.0, IQR=7.0) (p<0.001). The results showed significant differences between the before and during COVID-19 period for food quality and quantity across socio-demographic variables (gender, age group, parent's highest level of education, monthly household income, and household size). During the COVID-19 pandemic, students from a high-income and a small size family had the highest score in terms of food quality and quantity among other counterparts when compared to other counterparts. CONCLUSION Eating habits have significantly altered among school students during the COVID-19 pandemic. In spite of some good healthy habits enhanced among students, the quantity and the quality of the food was compromised. Therefore, the responsible officials at the Ministry of Education must focus on enhancing school students' awareness towards increased intake of healthy food and adopting good eating habits during the spread of pandemics and health diseases to avoid its negative effects on students."

977,10072020074334,"The presence of many completely uncharacterized proteins, even in well-studied organisms such as humans, seriously hampers full understanding of the functioning of the living cells. ADP-ribosylation is a common post-translational modification of proteins; also nucleic acids and small molecules can be modified by the covalent attachment of ADP-ribose. This modification, important in cellular signalling and infection processes, is usually executed by enzymes from the large superfamily of ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs) Here, using bioinformatics approaches, we identify a novel putative ADP-ribosyltransferase family, conserved in eukaryotic evolution, with a divergent active site. The hallmark of these proteins is the ART domain nestled between flanking leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains. LRRs are involved in innate immune surveillance. The novel family appears as likely novel ADP-ribosylation “writers”, previously unnoticed new players in cell signaling by this emerging post-translational modification. We propose that this family, including its human member LRRC9, may be involved in an ancient defense mechanism, with analogies to the innate immune system, and coupling pathogen detection to ADP-ribosyltransfer signalling."

This study, which employed a cross-sectional design, aimed to assess the mental health of emergency department medical staff during the epidemic in China. METHODS: Demographic data and mental health measurements were collected by electronic questionnaires from February 28, 2020 to March 18, 2020. OUTCOMES: A total of 14,825 doctors and nurses in 31 provinces of mainland China completed the survey. The prevalence rates of depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were 25.2% and 9.1%, respectively. Men were more likely to have depressive symptoms and PTSD than women. Those who were middle aged, worked for fewer years, had longer daily work time, and had lower levels of social support were at a higher risk of developing depressive symptoms and PTSD. Working in the Hubei province was associated with a higher risk of depressive symptoms, while those working in the Hubei province but residing in another province had a lower risk of depressive symptoms and PTSD. Being a nurse was associated with a higher risk of PTSD. INTERPRETATION: The findings suggest that targeted psychological interventions to promote the mental health of medical staff with psychological problems need to be immediately implemented. Special attention should be paid to local medical staff in Hubei."
979,10102020105724,"BACKGROUND: Maintaining health of healthcare workers with vaccination is a major component of pandemic preparedness and acceptance of vaccinations is essential to its success. This study aimed to examine impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on change of influenza vaccination acceptance and identify factors associated with acceptance of potential COVID-19 vaccination. METHOD: A cross-sectional self-administered anonymous questionnaire survey was conducted among nurses in Hong Kong, China during 26 February and 31 March 2020. Their previous acceptance of influenza vaccination and intentions to accept influenza and COVID-19 vaccination were collected. Their relationship with work-related and other factors were examined using multiple multinomial logistic regressions. RESULTS: Responses from 806 participants were retrieved. More nurses changed from vaccination refusal to hesitancy or acceptance than those changed from acceptance to vaccination hesitancy or refusal (15.5% vs 6.8% among all participants, P < 0.001). 40.0% participants intended to accept COVID-19 vaccination, and those in private sector (OR: 1.67, 95%CI: 1.11–2.51), with chronic conditions (OR: 1.83, 95%CI: 1.22–2.77), encountering with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients (OR: 1.63, 95%CI: 1.14–2.33), accepted influenza vaccination in 2019 (OR: 2.03, 95%CI: 1.47–2.81) had higher intentions to accept it. Reasons for refusal and hesitation for COVID-19 vaccination included “suspicion on efficacy, effectiveness and safety”, “believing it unnecessary”, and “no time to take it”. CONCLUSION: With a low level of COVID-19 acceptance intentions and high proportion of hesitation in both influenza and COVID-19 vaccination, evidence-based planning are needed to improve the uptake of both vaccinations in advance of their implementation. Future studies are needed to explore reasons of change of influenza vaccination acceptance, look for actual behaviour patterns of COVID-19 vaccination acceptance and examine effectiveness of promotion strategies."

981,10142021028830,"SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to trigger a wide spectrum of immune responses and clinical manifestations in human hosts. Here, we sought to elucidate novel aspects of the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection through RNA sequencing of peripheral blood samples from 46 subjects with COVID-19 and directly comparing them to subjects with seasonal coronavirus, influenza, bacterial pneumonia, and healthy controls. Early SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers a powerful transcriptomic response in peripheral blood with conserved components that are heavily interferon-driven but also marked by indicators of early B-cell activation and antibody production. Interferon responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrate unique patterns of dysregulated expression compared to other infectious and healthy states. Heterogeneous activation of coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways are present in early COVID-19, as are IL1 and JAK/STAT signaling pathways, which persist into late disease. Classifiers based on differentially expressed genes accurately distinguished SARS-CoV-2 infection from other acute illnesses (auROC 0.95 [95% CI 0.92–0.98]). The transcriptome in peripheral blood reveals both diverse and conserved components of the immune response in COVID-19 and provides for potential biomarker-based approaches to diagnosis."
982,10132021011870,"Purpose : To identify the impact the COVID-19 lockdown had on the presentation and management of sight-threatening ocular trauma. Methods : A retrospective cohort analysis of all patients who presented to the Ophthalmology department of Royal Hallamshire Hospital Sheffield with serious ocular trauma during the COVID-19 lockdown period was performed. Data on mechanism of injury and date of injury, presentation, and surgical repair were collected. This process was repeated for the same dates in the previous 5 years for comparison. Results : During the COVID-19 lockdown period, we saw 10 cases of serious ocular trauma (4 globe ruptures, 4 full-thickness lid lacerations, and 2 intra-ocular foreign bodies). This is 3.33 times the average number of cases over the previous 5 years. The delay between injury and presentation rose to 1.1 days compared to 0.33 days pre-COVID; however, the time taken between presentation to surgery was only slightly affected (12 hours in 2020 compared to 11.38 hours pre-COVID). Conclusion : During the COVID-19 lockdown, the number of serious ocular trauma cases was more than three times the average of the previous 5 years. This increase is partially due to more DIY injuries as people stayed at home, but also surprisingly an increase in falls. There did appear to be a longer delay between injury and presentation, suggesting that patients were reluctant to come into hospital during the pandemic. Surgery was performed within 12 hours on average for both groups, reassuringly indicating that sight-saving surgery was not delayed despite extraordinary circumstances."
983,10112020110496,"ABSTRACT: Individuals born extremely preterm are at significant risk for impaired neurodevelopment. After discharge from the neonatal intensive care, associations between the child’s well-being and factors in the home and social environment become increasingly apparent. Mothers’ prenatal health and socioeconomic status are associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes, and emotional and behavioral problems. Research on early life risk factors and on mechanisms underlying inter-individual differences in neurodevelopment later in life can inform the design of personalized approaches to prevention. Here, we review early life predictors of inter-individual differences in later life neurodevelopment among those born extremely preterm. Among biological mechanisms that mediate relationships between early life predictors and later neurodevelopmental outcomes, we highlight evidence for disrupted placental processes and regulated at least in part via epigenetic mechanisms, as well as perinatal inflammation. In relation to these mechanisms, we focus on four prenatal antecedents of impaired neurodevelopment, namely, (1) fetal growth restriction, (2) maternal obesity, (3) placental microorganisms, and (4) socioeconomic adversity. In the future, this knowledge may inform efforts to detect and prevent adverse outcomes in infants born extremely preterm. IMPACT: This review highlights early life risk factors and mechanisms underlying inter-individual differences in neurodevelopment later in life. The review emphasizes research on early life risk factors (fetal growth restriction, maternal obesity, placental microorganisms, and socioeconomic adversity) and on mechanisms (disrupted placental processes and perinatal inflammation) underlying inter-individual differences in neurodevelopment later in life.

986,10122020126486,"INTRODUCTION: In late January 2020, the Japanese government carried out three evacuations by aircraft from Wuhan, China, to avoid further cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among Wuhan's Japanese residents. Evacuation by aircraft may be an effective countermeasure against outbreaks of infectious diseases, but evidence of its effect is scarce. This study estimated how many COVID-19 cases were prevented among the Japanese residents of Wuhan by the evacuation countermeasure. METHODS: We constructed a SETAIR (susceptible-exposed-transitional-asymptomatic-infectious-recovered) model to capture the epidemic growth of COVID-19 cases in Wuhan to estimate the predicted number of COVID-19 cases among Wuhan's Japanese residents if evacuation had not occurred at the end of January. We used data on the number of COVID-19 cases confirmed in Hubei Province for the period Jan 20-Feb 16, 2020, and on the number of cases of Japanese residents who were evacuated by aircraft on Jan 29, 30, and 31. RESULTS: Eleven imported COVID-19 cases were reported on Feb 1 from among the total 566 evacuees who returned to Japan. In the case of no evacuations being made, the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases among Wuhan's Japanese residents was estimated to reach [Formula: see text] (95% CI [[Formula: see text]]) on Feb 8 and [Formula: see text] (95% CI [[Formula: see text]]) on Feb 15. A 1-week delay in the evacuation might be led to [Formula: see text] additional cases and a 2-week delay to [Formula: see text] additional cases. CONCLUSIONS: Evacuation by aircraft can contribute substantially to reducing the number of infected cases in the initial stage of the outbreak."
987,100720200711712,"For yet unknown reasons, severely ill COVID-19 patients often become critically ill around the time of activation of adaptive immunity. Here, we show that anti-Spike IgG from serum of severely ill COVID-19 patients induces a hyper-inflammatory response by human macrophages, which subsequently breaks pulmonary endothelial barrier integrity and induces microvascular thrombosis. The excessive inflammatory capacity of this anti-Spike IgG is related to glycosylation changes in the IgG Fc tail. Moreover, the hyper-inflammatory response induced by anti-Spike IgG can be specifically counteracted in vitro by use of the active component of fostamatinib, an FDA- and EMA-approved therapeutic small molecule inhibitor of Syk. One sentence summary Anti-Spike IgG promotes hyper-inflammation."
988,10082020080222,"From the perspective of gender roles, this study uses social capital as the intermediary variable to study female entrepreneurs’ willingness to choose external financing. We combine social and behavioral sciences and financing theory to explore interactions between gender roles, social capital, and willingness to choose external financing. We elaborate on the intermediary role of social capital between gender roles and external financing. We find differences in gender role types among female entrepreneurs that significantly impact their willingness to choose external financing. Further, the differences among gender role types of female entrepreneurs significantly impact their social capital, which in turn is a significant but not sole factor that mediates their willingness to choose external financing."
989,10032020032002,"Drug development is one of the most significant processes in the pharmaceutical industry. Various computational methods have dramatically reduced the time and cost of drug discovery. In this review, we firstly discussed roles of multiscale biomolecular simulations in identifying drug binding sites on the target macromolecule and elucidating drug action mechanisms. Then, virtual screening methods (e.g., molecular docking, pharmacophore modeling, and QSAR) as well as structure- and ligand-based classical/de novo drug design were introduced and discussed. Last, we explored the development of machine learning methods and their applications in aforementioned computational methods to speed up the drug discovery process. Also, several application examples of combining various methods was discussed. A combination of different methods to jointly solve the tough problem at different scales and dimensions will be an inevitable trend in drug screening and design."
990,10172021058875,"INTRODUCTION: Inherited retinal degenerations (IRD) are rare genetic disorders with > 300 known genetic loci, manifesting variably progressive visual dysfunction. IRDs were historically underserved due to lack of effective interventions. Many novel therapies will require accurate diagnosis (phenotype and genotype), thus an efficient and effective pathway for assessment and management is required. METHODS: Using surveys of existing practice patterns and advice from international experts, an all-Ireland IRD service (Target 5000) was designed. Detailed phenotyping was followed by next generation genetic sequencing in both a research and accredited laboratory. Unresolved pedigrees underwent further studies (whole gene/whole exome/whole genome sequencing). Novel variants were interrogated for pathogenicity (cascade screening, in silico analysis, functional studies). A multidisciplinary team (MDT; ophthalmologists, physicians, geneticists, genetic counsellors) reconciled phenotype with genotype. A bespoke care plan was created for each patient comprising supports, existing interventions, and novel therapies/clinical trials. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Prior to Target 5000, a significant cohort of patients were not engaged with healthcare/support services due to lack of effective interventions. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in IRD-associated genes were detected in 62.3%, with 11.6% having variants of unknown significance. The genotyping arm of Target 5000 allowed a 42.73% cost saving over independent testing, plus the value of MDT expertise/processing. Partial funding has transferred from charitable sources to government resources. CONCLUSION: Target 5000 demonstrates efficacious and efficient clinical/genetic diagnosis, while discovering novel IRD-implicated genes/variants and investigating mechanisms of disease and avenues of intervention. This model could be used to develop similar IRD programmes in small/medium-sized nations.

Structures of each of these compounds in complex with the protease revealed strategies for further development, as well as general principles for designing SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease inhibitors. These compounds may therefore serve as leads for the basis of building effective SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease inhibitors."
992,10052020050921,"A classification process can be seen as a set of actions by which several objects are evaluated in order to predict the class(es) those objects belong to. In situations where transparency is a necessary condition, predictions resulting from a classification process are needed to be interpretable. In this paper, we propose a novel variant of a naive Bayes (NB) classification process that yields such interpretable predictions. In the proposed variant, augmented appraisal degrees (AADs) are used for the contextualization of the evaluations carried out to make the predictions. Since an AAD has been conceived as a mathematical representation of the connotative meaning in an experience-based evaluation, the incorporation of AADs into a NB classification process helps to put the resulting predictions in context. An illustrative example, in which the proposed version of NB classification is used for the categorization of newswire articles, shows how such contextualized predictions can favor their interpretability."
993,10152021035106,"Objectives: To evaluate the knowledge of corneal donation and the new opt-out system among junior doctors in the East Midlands, UK. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study performed during June-September 2020. A 26-item questionnaire-based survey was disseminated to all 340 junior doctors working in the East Midlands, UK. Relevant data, including participants background, knowledge of corneal donation and the new opt-out system introduced in England, were analysed. Results: A total of 143 responses were received (response rate=42.1%). Nineteen (13.3%) junior doctors had previously discussed about corneal donation. The majority (100, 69.9%) of them perceived the importance of obtaining consent for corneal donation as junior doctors, but only 24 (16.8%) felt comfortable in discussing corneal donation. The knowledge of corneal donation was low, with a mean correct response rate of 33.3+/-20.8%. Only 28 (19.6%) doctors were aware of the 24-hour death-to-enucleation time limit. The majority (116, 81.1%) of doctors would consider certifying a death on the ward quicker if they knew it could potentially compromise the quality of corneas. Most (103, 72%) doctors were aware of the new opt-out system but only 56 (39.2%) doctors correctly stated that donation can only proceed with family consent. Conclusion: Junior doctors working at the frontline services serve as valuable members in contributing to the process of obtaining consent for organ/tissue donation. Our study highlights the lack of knowledge of corneal donation and the opt-out system amongst junior doctors in the UK. Targeted postgraduate training during the induction process may potentially enhance the donation rate."
994,10172021056858,"The need for tools which allow rapid detection and continuous monitoring of Sars-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) is greater than ever, as these variants are more transmissible and therefore increase the pressure of COVID-19 on healthcare systems. To address this demand, we aimed to develop and evaluate a robust and fast diagnostic approach for identification of Sars-CoV-2 VOC-associated spike gene mutations. Our diagnostic assays detect the E484K and N501Y SNPs as well as a spike gene deletion (HV69/70) and can be run on standard laboratory equipment or on the portable rapid diagnostic technology platform peakPCR. The assays achieved excellent diagnostic performance when tested with RNA extracted from culture-derived Sars-CoV-2 VOC lineages. Simplicity of usage and the relatively low costs are advantages which make our approach well-suited for decentralized and rapid testing, especially in resource limited settings."
995,10062020066931,"On January 8, 2020, a novel coronavirus was officially announced as the causative pathogen of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. On February 26, COVID-19 has been recognized in 34 countries, with a total of 80,239 laboratory-confirmed patients and 2700 deaths. Protecting healthcare workers from infectious hazards is paramount to ensuring their safety in delivering health care. In addition, being able to protect healthcare workers, constituting the front-line response against high-threat respiratory pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, is important for reducing secondary transmission in healthcare-associated outbreaks. Authors present a simple, reliable, and cheap protocol to produce a custom-made sterilizable filtering facepiece 2/3 masks for healthcare providers during pandemic COVID-19 emergency."
996,10122020127798,"The novel coronavirus disease (2019-nCoV) has been affecting global health since the end of 2019, and there is no sign that the epidemic is abating. Targeting the interaction between the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor is a promising therapeutic strategy. In this study, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was used as the primary method to screen a library of 960 compounds. A compound 02B05 (demethylzeylasteral, CAS number: 107316-88-1) that had high affinities for S-RBD and ACE2 was discovered, and binding affinities (K(D), μM) of 02B05-ACE2 and 02B05-S-RBD were 1.736 and 1.039 μM, respectively. The results of a competition experiment showed that 02B05 could effectively block the binding of S-RBD to ACE2 protein. Furthermore, pseudovirus infection assay revealed that 02B05 could inhibit entry of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus into 293T cells to a certain extent at nontoxic concentration. The compoundobtained in this study serve as references for the design of drugs which have potential in the treatment of COVID-19 and can thus accelerate the process of developing effective drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections."

998,10052020056388,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, many addiction treatment and harm reduction organizations have had to reduce their hours and services for people with substance use disorders, placing these individuals at increased risk of death. In order to address restricted treatment access during COVID-19, guidance from the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration, the US Drug Enforcement Administration, and the US Department of Health and Human Services has allowed for use of audio-only telehealth encounters for buprenorphine induction without requiring an in-person evaluation or video interface. This has enabled innovations in order to try to meet the needs of the most vulnerable among us during the current pandemic. In this new regulatory environment, we established the Rhode Island Buprenorphine Hotline, a phone hotline which functions as a “tele-bridge” clinic where people with moderate to severe opioid use disorder can be linked with a DATA 2000 waivered provider who can provide an initial assessment and, if appropriate, prescribe buprenorphine for unobserved induction and linkage to outpatient treatment. In this correspondence we briefly share our experience developing this common sense approach to addressing the complex problem of access to treatment only now permissible due to regulatory changes during COVID-19."
999,10112020111788,"Most respirators employed in health care settings, and often in first responder and industrial settings, are intended for single-use: the user dons the respirator, performs a work activity, and then doffs and discards the respirator. However, in the current COVID-19 pandemic, in the presence of persistent shortages of personal protective equipment, extended use and reuse of filtering facepiece respirators are routinely contemplated by many health care organizations. Further, there is considerable current effort to understand the effect of sterilization on the possibility of reuse, and some investigations of performance have been conducted. While the ability of such a respirator to continue to provide effective protection after repeated sanitization cycles is a critical component of implementing its reuse, of equal importance is an understanding of the impact that reusing the respirator multiple times in a day while performing work tasks, and even extending its wear over multiple days, has on the workplace protective performance. In this study, we subjected a stockpiled quantitatively fitted surgical style N95 filtering facepiece respirator device to extreme reuse and extended wear conditions (up to 19 uses over a duration of 5 days) and measured its protective performance at regular intervals, including simulated workplace protection factor measurements using total inward leakage. With this respirator, it was shown to be possible to maintain protection corresponding to an assigned protection factor greater than 10 under extreme usage conditions provided an individual is properly trained in the use of, and expertly fitted in, the respirator. Other factors such as hygiene and strap breakage are likely to place limits on reuse."
