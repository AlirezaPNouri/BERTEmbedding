            "doc 0: HURRYING through the tunnel at Veterans Stadium, the Los Angeles Rams' left guard, Tom Newberry, yelled, ''Warm-weather California sissies, huh?'' With a grin he disappeared into the locker room to calmly celebrate a 21-7 wild-card victory over the Philadelphia Eagles in a cold raw rain, which qualified the Rams to go against the Giants next Sunday at Giants Stadium in the Super Bowl XXIV tournament. But until yesterday, the Rams had always played like warm-weather California sissies in cold-weather playoff games. Until yesterday, the Rams were 0-9 in cold-weather playoff games since the franchise moved to Los Angeles from Cleveland more than four decades ago. In that time, Ram teams lost three outdoor playoff games in Minnesota (plus one in the warmth of the Metrodome a year ago), two in Washington, and one each in Cleveland, Detroit, Green Bay and Chicago. ''I'm tired of being a weatherman; if I get fired, I'm going right to the news,'' John Robinson, the Rams' coach, joked. ''But this wasn't a very nice day to play football.'' It wasn't a very nice day unless your team won, as Robinson's did, somewhat tediously but decisively. And these Rams enjoyed having accomplished in a cold-weather playoff what all those Ram teams with Bob Waterfield and Deacon Jones and Eric Dickerson never did. But the Eagles' strong safety, Andre Waters, may have inspired them. ''I was watching television last night when Waters came on,'' Newberry was saying now at his locker. ''Waters talked about how all those California Hollywood guys on the Rams don't want to get hit and don't want to play in the cold weather. Hey, I'm from Wisconsin; this was beautiful weather to play football.'' But beauty, of course, is in the eye of the beholder. And to the Rams, this beauty was 35 degrees at the opening kickoff with a gamelong drizzle but not much wind. ''We've got a lot of guys on this team who grew up playing football in cold weather,'' Newberry said. ''We want to prove we can win in cold weather.'' Jim Everett, the Rams' quarterback, described the weather as ''cold to the bone, but not a factor.'' But to anyone familiar with the weather at Giants Stadium at this time of year, it was almost tropical in Veterans Stadium yesterday. And if Everett thinks it was ''cold to the bone'' yesterday, he might find it cold to the marrow next Sunday if the wind is howling through the Giants Stadium freezer as it has in recent weeks. According to the National Weather Service's long-range forecast, a cold front Saturday night will create sunny temperatures in the 20's Sunday afternoon. Whatever the weather, the Giants must confront a Ram team that is playing about as well as any team in the entire National Football League right now. Of their last eight games, the Rams have won seven, starting with a 31-10 rout of the Giants in Anaheim Stadium. In that span, their only loss was to the San Francisco 49ers, 30-27, a Monday night game the Rams might have won and perhaps should have won. In their season finale, Everett rallied them to a 24-20 triumph in New England weather that was a windy 20 degrees and dropping at the kickoff, much colder than yesterday's weather here. Against the Eagles, the Rams jumped into a quick 14-0 lead midway through the first quarter on Everett's two touchdown passes, then waited until late in the fourth quarter to spring Greg Bell for a 52-yard gain, which positioned Bell's clinching 7-yard touchdown. Of Everett's 281 passing yards on 18 completions in 33 attempts, he had 173 yards in the first quarter, 108 yards in the first five minutes. Quite a contrast to his only previous playoff experience, the Rams' wild-card visit to Minnesota's Metrodome a year ago. In that 28-17 loss to the Vikings he completed only 19 of 45 passes with three interceptions. ''There were a lot of things I wanted to change this year,'' Everett was saying now. ''I wanted to develop the ability to win games late and the ability to win games in the playoffs.'' Equally important to the Rams was their unusual defensive alignment of five linebackers and six defensive backs, which stifled Randall Cunningham, the Eagles' quarterback, in obvious passing situations. ''We played zone, no man to man,'' explained Fritz Shurmer, the Rams' defensive coordinator. ''We wanted our defensive backs to be facing Cunningham in case he took off, we didn't want them turned around running with the receivers. When you're playing against Cunningham, you just hope you have him in a confined area. But we'll play a different defense against the Giants because they're a completely different offense.'' Three weeks ago, the Eagles were soaring, leading the National Conference East and having beaten the Giants twice. But their loss in New Orleans dropped them into second place. And now, suddenly, they're out of the Super Bowl tournament. And the Rams showed Cunningham that he's not yet ''the great quarterback'' he thinks he is. When the Giants' coach, Bill Parcells, and their general manager, George Young, assessed Cunningham not long ago as not having developed into a ''great quarterback'' yet, Cunningham was offended. But the Eagles are 0-2 in his two playoff games. For all his athletic ability, he hasn't yet been able to lift the Eagles when they needed it the most. And yesterday, Everett upstaged him. Robinson praised his Rams' ''will'' in yesterday's wild-card victory, and Everett talked about how ''my will is its will,'' meaning the team's will. But if the wind-chill's icy knifeblade slices through Giants Stadium next Sunday, the will of these self-styled ''California warm-weather sissies'' will be tested as never before.\n",
            "doc 1: FOR six years, American corporations have been buying their own stock in a big way. The original idea was to help protect the company from a takeover. But now the takeover threat is waning while the buybacks are as strong as ever. Clearly, they have taken on a life of their own, with important consequences for America's economy. Most companies pay for stock repurchases from profits or other funds on hand. Indeed, years of economic growth allowed corporate America to bank more than $120 billion since 1985, according to the Commerce Department. This mountain of cash could be paying for advanced machinery or, to take a gamble, financing the development of valuable new products: a new television technology, a supersonic commercial aircraft, a breakthrough medicine. And some is, but buying back stock has gotten the nod as the surest, most profitable way for a company to put the money to use. The choices are not black and white. Three companies that recently announced large buybacks, the General Electric Company, the NCR Corporation and the Union Camp Corporation, also spend on new factories and research. But they are doing so these days only up to a point. ''A number of companies are in effect saying that they already have too much invested in plant and equipment to earn an adequate return,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers. NCR illustrates the thinking. The company spent $416 million in 1988 and a bit more last year on the research and development of a range of products, from cash registers to main-frame computers. All this outlay came from retained earnings, but NCR was so profitable that at the end of September, it still had $600 million in the bank. The problem, as NCR management sees it, is that the company must earn at least 14 cents for every dollar invested in stock, or its shareholders would be justified in putting their money elsewhere. But beyond the $400 million-plus now being invested each year, NCR cannot find projects that it considers a good bet to return the required 14 percent in a short enough period of time, according to Mary Combs, NCR's assistant treasurer. ''We have a very strong shareholder concept, and we have become very clear about this in the last three years,'' she said. ''If we have an investment opportunity that will give us a great enough return, that's fine, but if not, the money should go back to the shareholders.'' True to this view, NCR announced just before Christmas that it would buy back 15 million shares over the next two years ($870 million at NCR's current price of $58 a share). This latest announcement brings NCR's buyback commitment to 35 million shares since December 1987. Once the task is completed, NCR will have only 55 million shares still outstanding. ''The choices seem to be to eventually become a private company or to go into some real cash-eating, risky investments,'' Ms. Combs said. ''Hopefully we will in time take the latter road and still satisfy shareholders.'' The mathematics behind the insistence on a high return for shareholders is fairly standard in American business today. Ms. Combs and others set as a goal the 8 to 9 percent annual return that a shareholder could earn simply by buying 10-year Treasury bonds. To that they add a 6 percent risk premium for equity, since the interest paid on Treasury bonds is a sure thing while the return to a shareholder is not. The logic of that math generates pressure to engage in buybacks. The Commerce Department reports that the average after-tax return on equity nationwide was 14.5 percent at an annual rate through the first half of 1989, down from 15.3 percent in 1988. As economic growth slows and profits decline, the temptation grows to increase per share earnings by reducing the number of shares outstanding. ''Buybacks provide instant gratification; capital investment takes longer to pay off,'' said Stephen S. Roach, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley. With fewer shares outstanding, each one automatically represents a bigger chunk of a company's earnings, which presumably attracts investors, pushes up the stock price and makes a takeover less likely. But other factors also help to explain why announced stock buybacks jumped above $10 billion in 1984, reaching $76 billion in 1987, and settling in at $55 billion in 1988 and nearly as much in 1989, according to data collected by Laszlo Birinyi of Birinyi Associates. The chief explanation involves the October 1987 crash and the plunge in stock prices last Oct. 13, events that made owning stocks unappetizing no matter what the return on equity. Buybacks surged in early 1988 and they are rising once again, as executives try to nudge stock prices up to what they think their companies are worth. General Electric's shares, for example, have risen by 10 percent since Nov. 17, when G.E. announced it would repurchase $10 billion in shares over five years. And a spokesman for Union Camp, the paper company, said its board had authorized a buyback of five million shares ''to be ready to act quickly if stock prices plunge again.'' Finally, some companies, like General Electric, had channeled retained earnings into diversification - in G.E.'s case, the purchase of the RCA Corporation and Kidder, Peabody, the Wall Street firm. Now excess cash is going into buybacks. ''They are a signal that diversification is no longer so desirable,'' said Walter Joelson, G.E.'s chief economist. Neither, apparently, are huge, risky - but potentially innovative - capital investments, although such outlays are essential if the United States is to keep up with Japanese and West German industries, many economists believe. Last year's announced buybacks represented 10 percent of the $500 billion in capital spending that was undertaken in 1989 in the United States. As Mr. Biryini put it: ''A buyback is a middle-of-the-road investment decision, between doing nothing, which risks a takeover, and making a long-term commitment that the stock market won't be quick to reward.''\n",

            "doc 3: Gary Anderson is the third-most accurate kicker in National Football League history. Today, he was No. 1 for the Pittsburgh Steelers. Anderson kicked a 50-yard field goal with 11 minutes 34 seconds left in overtime, giving Pittsburgh a 26-23 victory over the Houston Oilers in the American Conference wild-card playoff game. The kick came after Merril Hoge's 1-yard touchdown dive and Anderson's extra point tied the score at 23-23 with 46 seconds left in the fourth quarter. ''Nobody had given up and that made it doubly exciting,'' Anderson said. ''We played them three times and the last one counted.'' The Oilers finished their season with three straight defeats, including a 24-20 loss to Cleveland in the final 39 seconds in the regular-season finale in the Astrodome, where the Oilers had played so well this season. Houston beat the Steelers twice in the regular season, including a 27-0 shutout in the Astrodome. ''I thought as the week went on we did a good job of coming out of it and a lot of people played hard today,'' said Coach Jerry Glanville of the Oilers. The field goal was Anderson's fourth of the game, a club record for the playoffs, and sent the Steelers on to play the Denver Broncos, the Western Division champions, next Sunday at Mile High Stadium in Denver. In his career, Anderson is 7 for 16 from outside the 50-yard line. Anderson's field goals of 25, 30 and 48 yards before his game winner, and touchdown runs of 9 yards by Tim Worley and 1 by Hoge proved to be the final blow in the Oilers' late-season decline. Pittsburgh took a 16-9 lead in the fourth quarter, but the Oilers went ahead on touchdown passes of 18 and 9 yards from Warren Moon to Ernest Givins, who caught a career high 11 passes. ''I felt real good going into that situation,'' Anderson said. ''When they called time out it didn't bother me. I just go give my best shot.'' The Steelers lost their first two games of the season by a combined 92-10 score but they finished by winning five of their last six regular-season games and earned the playoff spot on the final day of the season. ''Needless to say, we're elated,'' Coach Chuck Noll said. ''It was very emotional for our football team just to make the playoffs.'' Critical Fumble The Oilers lost their last chance on their only offensive play of the overtime period when Lorenzo White fumbled at the Houston 47 and Rod Woodson recovered the ball. ''There's no question this game was a gut check,'' Noll said. ''There's no question the big play was when Woodson knocked the ball loose.'' Four plays later, Anderson kicked the game winner. Two weeks ago, the Oilers had a chance to win the A.F.C. Central Division title by winning at Cincinnati. Instead, the Bengals administered a 61-7 lambasting, and Houston went home to face Cleveland for another shot at the title. But Cleveland's Kevin Mack scored the winning touchdown with 39 seconds to play. This time, Glanville saw White's fumble lead to the loss. ''I saw the ball come out, and I knew it was a fumble,'' Glanville said. ''We talked all week about protecting the football because they are good at stripping it.'' Moon completed 29 of 48 passes 315 yards and two touchdowns. Bubby Brister of the Steelers hit 15 of 33 for 127 yards. Oilers Have Edge in Yardage The Steelers were outgained for the 14th time in 17 games this season but they have 10 victories. Houston outgained the Steelers by 215 to 138 yards in the first half and finished with a 380-289 margin. The Oilers did not lead until Givins beat Larry Griffin, a former Oiler safety, to the end zone with 9:14 left in the fourth quarter on his 18-yard touchdown. Givins caught his second touchdown, a 9-yarder, with 6:02 left in the fourth quarter. Houston's scoring in the first half came on field goals of 26 and 35 yards by Tony Zendejas, who missed a 55-yarder in the first drive of the game. Blocked Punt Leads to Score Pittsburgh's Jerry Olsavsky blocked a punt by Greg Montgomery in the first quarter, and Mark Stock recovered the ball at Houston's 32-yard line, setting up Worley's touchdown. Worley ran to his right side and did a one-handed handstand over into the end zone over Jeff Donaldson, a safety. Hoge broke three tackles to set up a 25-yard field goal by Anderson with 1:57 to go in the half. Hoge shrugged off tackle attempts by Al Smith, John Grimsley and Bubba McDowell before he was pushed out of bounds by Donaldson at the Oilers 27. Moon had three passes dropped, one by Curtis Duncan in the end zone, and had to recover his own fumble near the Oilers goal line in the first half. Moon hit Drew Hill for 16 yards on third down to the Steelers 21 before Zendejas's 26-yarder, and McDowell recovered a fumble at the Pittsburgh 41 that led to Zendejas's second field goal of the first half. Coach's Call Glanville said Sunday that the news media apparently have better sources than he does about his job security. A nationally televised report by NBC's Bobby Beathard said Glanville would be dismissed if he did not take the Oilers to the Super Bowl. ''I called Bobby Beathard and asked him how he could make an erroneous statement like that,'' Glanville said. ''He said he didn't make it up, that he talked to someone in the Oiler organization. ''I asked him to reveal his source so I could talk to him and he declined. I guess he has better sources on the team than I do.'' Glanville, with one year remaining on his contract, received the support of Givins. ''As far as I'm concerned, he's still my head coach,'' Givins said. ''He definitely takes the pressure off the players.'' Sean Jones, a Houston defensive end, also praised Glanville. ''He's taken the team to the playoffs three years in a row,'' Jones said. ''How many coaches have done that?'' The Oilers, Cleveland, Minnesota and San Francisco are the only teams to make the playoffs in each of the last three years.\n",

The move appeared to be another step aimed at making the currency convertible and improving trade prospects. Until now, the zloty could not be used for international transactions because it is not convertible to other currencies. Polish radio said Sunday that the new official exchange rate set by the bank will be 9,500 zlotys to $1 as of Monday. On Saturday, the zloty hovered at about 9,000 to $1.

            "doc 5: Despite some seemingly spectacular successes, the drug war in South America is not going well. Critics say the American military attack on Panama, justified in part as an anti-drug initiative, has only fragmented what is already a largely ineffective effort. Despite the lack of sympathy for Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega of Panama, Latin America was clearly shaken by the latest case of United States military force in the region. Peru dramatized that reaction by pulling out of an Andean summit meeting on drugs with President Bush, set for February, and briefly halting an anti-drug effort with the United States. Because Peru grows 70 percent of the coca plants processed into the cocaine that is smuggled into the United States, its withdrawal from the summit talks dashed hopes for a start on a cohesive regional plan. Peru Could Become Sanctuary Colombia and Bolivia, the other two major cocaine producers in South America, say they still plan to meet with President Bush in February. But without Peru's cooperation, narcotics experts say, the drug war cannot succeed, because the country would become a huge sanctuary for growers and drug traffickers pursued by the two neighboring countries. Trying to knock Panama off the cocaine-distribution map by taking out General Noriega, who has long been linked to the drug traffic, was not a fair trade for the alienation of Peru, critics say. Panama's importance in the drug trade was waning as tension between General Noriega and the United States grew and drug traffickers and money launderers left for more tranquil points in the Caribbean, Mexico, Canada, Europe and Asia. Mr. Bush's campaign to stop cocaine at its source in the Andes, part of a broader drug strategy announced in September, includes $2 billion in economic aid to Peru, Bolivia and Colombia over four years and $261 million mainly in aid to the military and police in those countries. But four months into the campaign, the picture is bleak. Cocaine is flowing as freely as ever to the United States, where the appetite for crack remains ravenous, and it is becoming increasingly clear that for the Andes nations themselves, cutting cocaine production and exports is by no means the No. 1 priority. Colombia has embarked on a campaign to arrest its major traffickers and seize their assets, but for every trafficker who falls, another replaces him, overseeing the processing of the coca leaf at jungle laboratories and arranging for the shipment of cocaine to North America. And the coca plant continues to be cultivated in Peru and Bolivia, where poor farmers have discovered its value as a cash crop. In an interview, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, characterized the Administration's campaign as ''little more than a paper initiative.'' ''The United States,'' he said, ''must launch a genuine plan for the Andes, not just a laundry list of disjointed initiatives.'' The Administration's response is that the problem of cocaine smuggling from Latin America has been building since the early 1970's, and that it will take time to solve. ''We can show some little successes, but over all it's going to take several years,'' said a United States official in Peru. ''We're just getting into the ballgame, just starting to get the resources we need.'' Some Administration officials working on drug issues in Washington say they do not expect to see any measurable effect on the flow of cocaine into the United States until late 1990. ''That's just a realistic assessment of how long it takes government to work,'' one said. Some Bush aides acknowledged that the Panama invasion has not been a plus for the drug war, and one said it was ''catastrophically negative'' and indicated that Washington was holding out hope that Peru would ultimately decide to join in the Andean summit meeting now that it has resumed its anti-drug program with the United States. Colombia One Kingpin Down, But Many to Go One of the most notable successes in the drug fight came in mid-December, when Colombian security forces chased down and killed Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, a powerful and violent leader of the Medellin cartel, which controls much of the world cocaine market. It was a major accomplishment for Colombia, and it bolstered public support after drug bosses had repeatedly escaped police raids and terrorized the capital, Bogota, with nightly bombings. In the last two weeks drug terrorism has dropped significantly. And there is some evidence that drug-ring leaders are now fighting each other. But the American and Colombian authorities say Mr. Rodriguez Gacha's death will have little effect on the export of cocaine because someone will win the battle to succeed him and simply pick up the slack. And Colombian traffickers, who control most of the cocaine industry worldwide, are moving their jungle factories, where paste from the the coca leaf is processed into powder. The refineries are being set up in Peru and Bolivia and even along the frontiers of Brazil and Ecuador, which until now had been relatively free of drug traffic. Scores of smaller Colombian drug processers and shippers and some of the major traffickers who have operated quietly and without violence have been left alone by the Government. Should the level of terrorism remain low for an extended period, some Colombian experts predict, the Government will declare victory and permit the peaceful drug traffickers to go about their business. In Colombia, as in Peru and Bolivia, political power and economic conditions are more important concerns. ''We are fighting two wars in Colombia,'' Carlos Lemos Simmonds, the senior member of President Virgilio Barco Vargas's Cabinet and the President's chief political adviser, said in an interview, referring to the war against drugs and the war between drug traffickers and the nation's leaders. ''The deadlier war is the one of the drug barons against our own politicians, our judges, our journalists,'' he said. ''They want to be the ones who govern the country. They want to make Colombia into a narco-state, so they can handle their business more easily. Both wars are urgent. But we have to stop these people from killing other Colombians. This has priority.'' Peru and Bolivia A Profitable Habit Hard to Break Presidents Alan Garcia of Peru and Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia argue that the solution to the drug problem lies not in force but in broad economic development - road building, electrification, agricultural services, the introduction of industry - along with price supports to make other crops more attractive than coca. The high profits from cocaine have made the Bolivian and Peruvian Governments reluctant to move against it, and few farmers have been willing to switch to other crops. Some Bolivian farmers have taken United States and Bolivian money, offered as an inducement for destroying coca plots and cultivating other crops, and moved to remote fields to plant more coca. In Peru, the Upper Huallaga Valley is the world's most fertile ground for the coca plant, and farmers there have virtually halted the cultivation of any other crop. The $2 billion in economic aid pledged by President Bush to Peru, Bolivia and Colombia over four years works out to about $166 million a year for each of the countries, an enormous jump. But Mr. Garcia and Mr. Paz Zamora are talking about $500 million a year and more. For Peru, the gravest concern is the Shining Path, a Maoist guerrilla movement that has been terrorizing the country for nearly 10 years. Mr. Garcia argues that pressure on coca farmers only provides recruits for the guerrillas, who exploit the cocaine trade by protecting the farmers and then ''taxing'' both them and those whom the Shining Path permits to export the drug. Bolivia's economy has forced many workers to protest conditions. The nation is under a state of siege, imposed after teachers began demanding raises that would have upset a long-range restructuring of the economy away from central controls. Colombia says it needs good prices for its main legitimate export, coffee, and fewer restrictions on its exports to of freshly cut flowers and textiles to the United States. But under pressure from American coffee makers for more advantageous prices and different mixes of beans, the United States has walked away from an international coffee agreement on price supports. World coffee prices have plunged, and Colombia says it will lose about $500 million a year unless the agreement is restored. Administration officials say they are trying to find a way for Colombia to recoup its loss, but the talks involve dozens of countries and are going slowly. Senator Biden proposes that to assist the drug-producing nations in reorganizing or bolstering their economies, a ''debt for drugs'' swap should be made. The United States would pay off the big foreign debts of the cocaine-producing countries under the plan in exchange for a program of coca-crop eradication and encouragement of alternate crops. United States Lack of Agreement And Coordination In the United States, the Bush Administration is confronted by competing interests among Washington agencies. Some, like the Commerce Department, show little active interest in the South American drug problem, despite the coca crop's inevitable intertwining in Andes economics and trade. Some, like the Pentagon, are not in agreement on the wisdom of the United States involvement in the Andes drug problems. Critics say the Administration's efforts are disjointed. At least six United States Government agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the State Department, are working against drugs in the three countries. Each agency has its own procedures and intelligence sources. Theoretically, the United States ambassador coordinates the drug war in his country. But in practice, central direction is weak and each agency goes its own way. ''We are far from having a strategy,'' said Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan, chairman of the House Select Committee on Narcotics. William J. Bennett, the nation's drug-policy director, has been criticized by politicians and experts in drug treatment for failing to take his advisers' counsel and take charge of an overall drug plan. A Government expert said, ''Bennett has done fine on the bully pulpit talking about the drug problem, but he seems unwilling to seize the power needed to really do anything.'' Donald R. Hamilton, the chief spokesman for Mr. Bennett, said the director had exerted sweeping influence on how the United States is dealing with drugs. ''He has good access to the President and when he's gone to the President he's gotten his way almost every time.'' Within the United States armed forces, opinion is divided over whether the military should be involved in the drug war in South America. Many officers, remembering Vietnam, worry that the military will be drawn into an unwinnable war. ''We will be down there 20 to 40 years,'' said a senior planning officer in the United States military headquarters in Panama. Some officers think the armed forces could become a scapegoat if the anti-drug war fails. ''It is easier for politicians to shift the burden to the military than to get tough with their own drug-using constitutents,'' said a Pentagon officer who bitterly oppposes using servicemen in the drug war. Despite the misgivings, the Defense Department has ordered stepped-up training, reconnaissance, intelligence sharing and logistical support in the three Andean countries. The Andes The Divisive Issue Of Who Will Fight Mainly because of unextinguishable bad memories of gunboat diplomacy, the leaders of Colombia, Bolivia and Peru oppose the presence of American combat troops on their soil, and they want strict limits on any American military presence. Of the three countries, only Colombia has been willing to mount a real armed offensive of its own. Peru and Bolivia continue to equivocate on waging any kind of warfare on an industry that provides an income for hundreds of thousands of peasants. A key to the United States strategy is to engage the armies of all three countries in the drug war, but these forces have historically insisted that drug trafficking is a criminal matter for the police to confront. Friction between the police and the armed forces runs deep; they seldom work together, and when they do they blame each other for what goes wrong. In Peru the army actually prevents the police from operating in the Upper Huallaga Valley. Disturbing the coca farmers, the army says, would help the guerrillas by driving the farmers into rebel ranks. But tantalized by the potential of as much as $40 million in United States military hardware for an anti-drug campaign, the army now contends that through its war with the guerrillas it should be regarded as actually fighting cocaine. While drugs have been a police concern, most police officers have been assigned to other duties. Of the 80,000 members of the police in Colombia, for example, only about 3,500 are assigned to anti-drug units. In Peru, there are about 500 anti-narcotics police officers, and in Bolivia there are 700 to 800. Mexico New Way Stations South of the Border A United States official in Bogota who specializes in narcotics estimated that cocaine shipping from Colombia was still down about 25 percent from what it was before the Government of President Barco declared war on the drug traffickers last August. But he said new processing centers in Peru and other countries, especially Mexico, may have lifted the region as a whole back to where it had been. As United States patrols and radar networks have slowed traffic in the Caribbean, cocaine smugglers have been funneling their goods into the United States through Mexico. The Colombian cartels have formed alliances with Mexican smuggling gangs that have long dealt in marijuana and heroin. ''You have organizations on both sides of the border who have been involved with smuggling for decades,'' said a United States official in Mexico. Drug Enforcement Administration officials estimate that 50 percent to 70 percent of all South American cocaine entering the United States goes through Mexico, as opposed to 30 percent only a few years ago. Nearly 300 planes were seized in the raids in Colombia, but American officials say the traffickers have replenished their fleet by buying and stealing replacements all over the hemisphere. One of the most popular smuggling planes, the officials said, is the Gulfstream Aerocommander 1000, a twin-engine turboprop plane that can carry up to 2,000 pounds of cargo. Most of Mexico does not have radar coverage. Planes land at hundreds of dirt airfields and often keep one engine running as the cocaine is unloaded. Usually, the drug is hidden at the airfield for a few days, then smuggled across the border by truck. The United States has been putting up a barrier of radar balloons along the Mexican border; seven are to be up within weeks. The balloons can detect a plane as far away as 150 miles. In all three Andes countries and in the United States, politicians as well as scholars and economists talk of what they regard as the impossibility of significantly reducing the production and export of cocaine as long as demand remains strong. The most optimistic analysts estimate 5 to 10 years of heavy spending and perhaps much bloodshed, not to eliminate cocaine in South America but to contain it until consumption falls. ''We're buying time,'' said one United States Embassy official here.\n",
            "doc 6: It has been a year of hurricanes and housing scandals, but also of quieter tales of American people and places. Here are the last, or at least the latest, chapters from the journals of 1989: William Van Orden, a sculptor in Venice, Calif., who is dying of cancer, finished yet another restoration of a statue of the actress Myrna Loy and has taken to his bed. An alarm system has been added to the metal cage that encloses the statue, and for the moment it is holding off the vandals who have destroyed the statue each time Mr. Van Orden has restored it, 12 times in the last decade by his count. But completion of the statue does not seem to have cured his unrequited ''romance'' with Myrna Loy, as he had hoped. ''I have still never heard from her,'' he said of the actress, who is now in her 80's and lives in New York City. ''That's a sad thing. It would have been nice to receive a little postcard or something.''

Earlier this year, readers in this city of 1,800 in the heart of Kansas oil and cattle country had a choice in which they took little consolation: rival weeklies produced by feuding factions of one family. They were the 110-year-old Rooks County Record, owned by 76-year-old Leon Hamilton, and the upstart Stockton Sentinel, owned by his son Bob. The Sentinel is the survivor. Leon is wintering in Arizona and another son, Barry, who helped his father run the Record, has returned to his teaching job in Olanthe, Kan. The rift continues. Leon and Barry have filed suit seeking recovery of financial damages. ''And,'' Bob said recently, ''they don't even wave to my kids when they pass on the street.'' The prognosis for the Treaty Oak, the 500-year-old tree in Austin, Tex., that was poisoned last spring, is dim but not hopeless. Over the months tree doctors have ringed the patient with screens to prevent sunstroke and injected sugared water to provide energy. The total cost of care is already more than $100,000, most of it paid by the billionaire H. Ross Perot. John Giedraitis, the city forester, says the fate of the tree will not be clear until spring, when it attempts to put out new leaves. Since its fate became known. the tree has stirred interest from around the world. Said Mr. Giedraitis: ''Think of it: all these people praying for a vegetable. Well, a member of the vegetable family.'' Pat Galati's Union Oil Service Station and Minute Man Car Wash, it turns out, is not after all a monument to the culture of Los Angeles. The city's Cultural Heritage Commission denied the request of a local preservation group to enshrine the carwash and thereby save it from a developer. But the carwash lovers are fighting on. They have tied up the developer in environmental impact requirements and proposed another solution: keep the carwash and use a little leftover land for a four-story parking garage.

But theirs is a story with special poignancy because the Camelot was a special hotel. Just months before, the sour-smelling corridors had been the haunt of drug dealers, with law-abiding residents cowering behind barricaded doors. Then a neighborhood homeless man, Craig Lee, was hired to manage the hotel, chasing the dealers and restoring a small measure of order to a squalid and dangerous place. Mr. Lee, himself a vagabond, disappeared from the Camelot last fall, weeks before the quake. Neighborhood residents in the Tenderloin District say Mr. Lee went back to Alabama, although nobody knows for sure. Forwarding addresses are rare in the Tenderloin - and so are happy endings.\n",
            "doc 7: George Perles, a controversial but successful coach on three levels, yesterday became the first of half a dozen finalists to be interviewed for the Jets' head-coaching job. The Michigan State coach met for two hours in the morning with Dick Steinberg, the Jets' new general manager. They spoke in the Los Angeles area, where Steinberg was scouting three bowl games. Perles joined him from Hawaii, where the Spartans won the Aloha Bowl on Monday. 'Good Exchange of Ideas' In a perfunctory statement that did not indicate Steinberg's impressions, the general manager said, ''We had a good exchange of ideas and will continue the process of interviewing for a head coach.'' Steinberg has said he does not want to drag out the interview process, and has a short list. He has already asked the Cincinnati Bengals' offensive coordinator, Bruce Coslet, to be interviewed. After Michigan State's victory in Hawaii, and before Steinberg dismissed Coach Joe Walton, Perles said, ''If there's an opening and the Jets want to talk to me, I'll certainly talk to them.'' The president of Michigan State, John DiBiaggio, last week gave Perles clearance to seek a pro job, even though the school has an opening for an athletic director. Perles has twice before apparently accepted pro head-coaching jobs only to remain at Michigan State. Many people believed he was ready to take the top post with the Green Bay Packers almost two years ago. Surprise for Packers Lee Remmel, the Packers' executive director of public relations, recalled yesterday: ''I was preparing a news release before the January 1988 Super Bowl, that Perles was coming to Green Bay to replace Forrest Gregg. As I understand it, he had agreed to a five-year contract with us. In fact, the night before he had even hired several assistants. ''That morning I called Bob Harlan, who was our vice president, to get some quotes from Perles, and Bob told me, 'He's not coming.' That day Perles signed a 10-year deal with Michigan State.'' And a few years before that, he was reported to have accepted the coaching post with the Philadelphia Stars of the United States Football League. Instead, he remained at East Lansing. Perles compiled an admired record as a pro assistant with the Pittsburgh Steelers. He left them for Michigan State, his alma mater, after the 1981 season. He served under Chuck Noll as defensive-line coach, defensive coordinator and assistant head coach. He was the line coach of the famed Steel Curtain defensive front, which helped lead the Steelers to four Super Bowl victories. He has been with the Spartans since 1982. He was also a legendary high school coach in his native Detroit, where he compiled a 23-2 record, with two state championships, at St. Ambrose from 1962 through 1964. 'Real Intense' One of his former players at St. Ambrose, Tom Landau, a halfback, recalled yesterday that Perles was ''real intense, oriented to line play and defensive play.'' Steinberg has already said he believes defense is the first ingredient in rebuilding a team, along with the ability to run the ball. ''In his third year he took over the school's offense,'' said Landau, now a claims manager for an insurance company. ''He had a grind-it-out approach. He put a heavy emphasis onbeing able to block, even for the halfbacks.'' Landau recalls Perles as a ''streets of Detroit guy.'' ''That's where he was from and it shaped the way he acted,'' he said. ''He was tough, but he was very loyal. If he thought you were with him, he stuck by you. But if he thought you weren't, you were his enemy for life.'' Landau suggested that this attitude may be at the root of recently publicized problems Perles has had with the news media in East Lansing. ''The team, that's all that mattered to him,'' said Landau, who followed Perles to the University of Dayton. Perles went from there to Michigan State under Duffy Daugherty before going to the Steelers. Perles is not the only college coach Steinberg is believed to be interested in. Others are Howard Schnellenberger of Louisville and John Mackovic of Illinois, both former National Football League head coaches. The current N.F.L. assistants Steinberg may talk to besides Coslet include Wade Phillips, defensive coordinator of the Denver Broncos; Floyd Peters, defensive coordinator of the Minnesota Vikings, and Mike Holmgren, offensive coordinator of the San Francisco 49ers. ----Beathard to Chargers SAN DIEGO, Dec. 31 (AP) -Bobby Beathard, who molded Super Bowl champions in Miami and Washington, has agreed to become general manager of the San Diego Chargers. Beathard, admitting he missed football in his year as a network broadcaster, said on NBC's ''N.F.L. Live'' pre-game show that he would try to meet with Alex Spanos, the Chargers' owner, later this week and complete the agreement. ''I still need to sign a contract, and I just want to sit down and talk about a couple of things with Mr. Spanos,'' Beathard said in an interview.  ''I found out during the season that I did miss football,'' Beathard said, ''although I've had a lot of fun here.'' The 52-year-old Beathard would replace Steve Ortmayer, who was dismissed on Dec. 18 after he was criticized for a series of trades that failed to improve the club. Beathard was director of player personnel for the Dolphins from 1972 until joining the Redskins as general manager on Feb. 24, 1978.\n",
            "doc 8: Confronted by growing demands that the Communist Party dissolve itself, top officials of this country's old order say they will call a special congress to dismantle the disgraced party even before free elections are held in April. Late Saturday night, a group of party officials, many of whom quickly severed their relationship with the Ceausescu dictatorship as a popular uprising swept it out of power, went on the national television to announce the special congress. Their message was repeated today in the Rumanian newspapers, which like the television are now controlled by the country's new, non-Communist leaders. While many of the party's leading figures have been detained since President Nicolae Ceausescu's overthrow, those now urging the party's dissolution appear to be high-ranking officials seeking a new political profile before the open elections are held. Swirl of Revolutionary Fervor The eagerness to erase all vestiges of the once-mighty Communists has risen up among students on the streets and long-suppressed artists and intellectuals, and even within the party's decimated ranks. The cry reflects the swirl of revolutionary fervor in a land not used to its new freedoms after 24 years of dictatorship, a country wary that the old guard that flourished under Mr. Ceausescu may reassert itself and uncertain of where it is heading with many former Communists still holding potent positions in the bureaucracy. The fervor leaves the authorities in a quandary. Such was the reach of Communist power during the years of Mr. Ceausescu's dominance that many people saw the party as the sole means of advancement. One-Third of Adult Population Its membership was estimated at 3.8 million, about one-third of the adult population, and party officials were favored for promotion. While many people have given up their membership since the demonstrations and bloodshed that surrounded Mr. Ceausescu's ouster, others in pivotal positions have been retained for their expertise. ''The party will be dissolved,'' said Maria Voyinescu, a 28-year-old artist from the Black Sea town of Constanza. ''That is what everybody wants.'' Miss Voyinescu joined others from her home today who were parading a wreath in Bucharest to mourn those who died in the revolt. Andrei Fornvald, a 24-year-old electronics student who said he took part in the demonstration that lead to Mr. Ceausescu's overthrow on Dec. 22, said: ''The party should now be dissolved. The people want a new start.'' Christian Lascu, a scientist in his 30's, said: ''They will change the name of the party, but it will be the same. It must be dissolved or they will reorganize. What people fear is that the repressive system of Ceausescu will work for the new government.'' The comments came in a series of random interviews today on Bucharest streets, where Rumanians celebrating the new year formed lines to shop for unaccustomed goods like vodka, wine, oranges and foreign cigarettes, delicacies that have become available in the last week as the nation's bounty, long diverted abroad in the interest of hard currency, has finally found its way to the capital. Among intellectuals, academics, poets and other onetime anti-Communist dissidents, who formed a new organization today called the Group of Social Dialogue, a sense emerged that while the old Communist leadership has been formally swept away, the new authorities have yet to establish credentials as untainted successors. 'They Have to Prove Themselves' ''The Communist Party was dissolved by the youth of this country, by the people of this country,'' Mirca Dinescu, a well-known poet and dissident under Mr. Ceausescu's rule, told a news conference called to announce the formation of the new group. But referring to the Council of National Salvation, which grew from the revolution to lead the country, he declared, ''They have to prove themselves from now on.'' ''Many of us are skeptical right now,'' he said. Under aggressive questioning from Rumanian reporters about the continued strength of former Communist officials in the new administration, Corneliu Bogdan, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and Government spokesman, told a news conference today: ''There were 3.8 million members of the party. If we exclude them from all jobs, the whole economy will stop.'' ''There were many Communists who opposed Ceausescu,'' Mr. Bogdan said. ''We cannot exclude the Communists as such. There is no danger of them getting power again. The Communist Party is finished. Those who are among the leaders are in a minority.'' The Council of National Salvation released a 27-member list of a new Government today that included four army generals who had risen through the ranks under Mr. Ceausescu, some Communists who had run afoul of Mr. Ceausescu like Culture Minister Andrei Plesu, and other, lesser-known figures viewed as technocrats. In practical terms, the revolution swept the party away. Its headquarters in central Bucharest have been taken over by the Council. And in factories across the land, many party figures are reported to have simply dropped their titles in an attempt to disavow their past. Secret Police Chief Arrested The Communists' decline was felt as the former secret police chief under Mr. Ceausescu, Iulian Vlad, was arrested today along with two former Deputy Interior Ministers, Giani Bucurescu and Aristotel Stamatoiu, and Vasile Gheorghe, another senior Interior Ministry offical, the Rumanian news agency Agerpres reported. The four have been removed from active duty and were being held for questioning, Agerpres said. Mr. Vlad is a colonel general, while the other three are lieutenant generals. Many Rumanians now say they joined the Communist Party not out of ideological commitment or loyalty to Ceausescu, but simply to secure employment. ''Nobody forced me to join the Communist Party, but I had to become a member or I would have lost my job,'' said Dan Ghibernea, a senior official of the Academy of Social and Political Sciences. Referring to Mr. Ceausescu, Maris Sorescu, a 53-year-old poet who joined the party in 1968, said, ''The social mechanisms of Communism should be destroyed, because it produces this kind of people.'' But the authorities, focusing on such issues as the formation of a government and drawing up rules for new elections, seem sharply at odds with those on the street demanding the party's dismantling. Pledge of Elections Renewed Mr. Bogdan, for instance, referred to the issue of the party's influence as ''diversion'' and said the only thing to be gained from its dismantling would be to simplify the disposal of its assets. As a former Communist himself, he defended his decision to join the party, saying he had done so honestly. The spokesman is a former Ambassador to the United States. The authorities have promised free elections in April, and Mr. Bogdan renewed that pledge today. Acknowledging the proliferation of new political parties since the revolution, the Council of National Salvation announced on the radio that any parties except those deemed fascist or extremist could now be legally formed, provided its sponsors could produce a petition bearing 251 signatures to support its application for registration. Only days after the revolution, however, some Rumanians give and impression that they have yet to fully come to grips with their freedom. Silviu Brucan, one of the country's best-known dissidents, said in an article published today that traditional Communist theory based on the teachings of Marx had been ''atomized and destroyed'' by the Ceausescu era. ''We do not have a theory,'' he said. ''We do not know in which world we live. And we do not know in which way we are going. In the months that come we will have to learn not only democracy, but thinking without dogma, without prejudice, without 'isms,' '' he said.\n",
            "doc 9: Pat LaFontaine scored three times, extending his goal-scoring streak to seven games, to lead the New York Islanders to a 4-2 victory over the Buffalo Sabres tonight. LaFontaine, who took over the league lead with 33 goals, has 12 goals in his last seven games, during which the Islanders are 6-1. Buffalo, the National Hockey League point leader with 52, has lost its last two games, both at home, after a six-game unbeaten streak. The Sabres were stymied by the goaltender Mark Fitzpatrick, who made 38 saves. The Islanders scored twice in less than two minutes early in the second period to take a 3-1 lead before Scott Arniel scored to bring the Sabres within a goal going into the final period. LaFontaine's second of the game, set up by Derek King's digging behind the net, snapped a 1-1 tie at 5:48 of the middle period. King stole the puck from the defenseman Uwe Krupp and fed LaFontaine on the edge of the crease for a tap-in. Jari Gronstrand made it 3-1 with his first goal of the season at 7:10, putting a short backhander past Daren Puppa while being knocked to the ice. Benoit Hogue set up Arniel's goal at 18:04, streaking across the Islanders' blue line before passing to Arniel, who beat Fitzpatrick with a 35-foot slap shot. But LaFontaine completed his hat trick with the only goal of the third period, beating Puppa on a breakaway at 15:55.\n",
            "doc 10: AT a number of American newspapers, it has become almost a fad to publish pullout news sections focused on a single topic. But some editors are beginning to question whether many of these sections are worth their price in manpower and money, and it is widely believed in the industry that some sections are heavily influenced by hopes of winning journalism awards. Indeed, in a period when business pressures have made pleasing the readers a very high priority, some editors suspect that such sections may drive readers out of newspapers by either distracting them from the regular news sections or boring them with thousands of words on a subject that readers may care little about. Mike Pride, the editor of The Concord Monitor in New Hampshire, considered publishing an exhaustive investigation of the state's tax system in a special section, but decided instead to present the material over a five-day period in the regular news section of the paper. ''I decided a section would rob the daily paper,'' Mr. Pride said. Such sections generally carry no advertising and are often labeled ''special report'' or ''special supplement'' to suggest to readers that they are getting a bonus of in-depth news coverage. Readers of The Chicago Tribune recently received a 50,000-word report on the role of medical politics in AIDS research. Newsday on Long Island and New York Newsday wrapped a recent Sunday issue in a 24-page section entitled ''One Day in the Drug Crisis.'' The Gwinnett Daily News, a small daily outside Atlanta that is owned by The New York Times Company, published a long supplement on Georgia prisons a year ago. In each of these cases, the newspaper's editor said the pullout sections covered newsworthy subjects that deserved large-scale reporting efforts. For instance, Anthony Marro, the editor of Newsday, said his drug-crisis project was tentatively approved last January when several special projects were chosen for the coming year. Work on the project began in June. The editors also said they chose to publish the material in a special section as a convenience to readers. ''We tried to split it up into a conventional newspaper series,'' said Jack Fuller, the editor of The Chicago Tribune, referring to the paper's huge report on AIDS, ''and it was doable, but even more difficult for readers.'' Such special sections always represent a huge commitment of time, energy and resources. The Tribune investigation occupied all the time of one of the paper's top investigative reporters for nearly two years. The Newsday supplement involved 50 reporters and photographers. Editors say the debate over special sections raises broader questions. At issue is the motivation behind devoting a big chunk of a newsroom budget to provide coverage that may far exceed reader interest, whether that coverage takes the form of special sections, a series of related articles, or many articles on a particular topic over a period of time. For small newspapers, a big investigation can be particularly difficult to justify because staff and space are already quite limited. But James R. Osteen, the executive editor of The Gwinnett News, said such projects could also be especially important at small dailies because they build morale and confidence in the newsroom and provide a public service. His section on prisons gave the suburban paper's readers great detail on every jail in the state. ''Sometimes, editors have to make the call that these are things it is important to know about,'' Mr. Osteen said. ''Maybe people would rather read about Zsa Zsa, but the prison problem in Georgia affects everybody.'' Because such in-depth efforts are often entered in journalism competitions, there is widespread suspicion among editors that some of their professional colleagues - though they decline to name names - may be making news judgments with one eye on winning a journalism award. ''You can't go through a list of a hundred-odd entries for prizes and not come up with a number of cases where somebody stuck a stick of dynamite under a gnat,'' said John Seigenthaler, the publisher of The Tennessean in Nashville and a longtime participant in the selection of Pulitzer Prize finalists. Claudia Stone, who handles Pulitzer entries for Columbia University, said special sections or multi-part series have won about a third of the 15 prizes in the last two years. Mr. Fuller, Mr. Marro and Mr. Osteen said their decisions to publish special sections were not motivated by the prospect of winning a prize, though they said that their sections had either been submitted for awards or were likely to be. Many editors concede that the excellent journalism that wins a prize may also be generally ignored by readers. Mr. Seigenthaler directed an 18-month investigation of a local Congressman, which resulted in many, many articles and the series was a runner-up for a Pulitzer Prize. But he says he now has no doubt that the coverage was considerably in excess of reader interest, and he questions his judgment in publishing so much on such a subject. ''You do wonder at what point readers turn us off,'' he said. Yet it is an article of faith among newspaper editors that news decisions should be sensitive to reader taste, but not ruled by it. And they say that sometimes a newspaper has an obligation to publish articles of importance, even if they will not be widely read. Mr. Fuller said he did not know whether The Chicago Tribune's special section on AIDS had been well read, but he said he did think an editor should not expect every reader to read every article. ''A newspaper's an old curiosity shop,'' he said. ''You don't edit every story for every person.''\n",
            "doc 11: Gregory Johnson's Purple Heart was pinned to his pillow, and a three-foot-high inflatable Santa stood near his bed. Through clenched teeth, the 24-year-old Marine sergeant from Anchorage, Alaska, told visitors at Wilford Hall Air Force Medical Center here that it was ''pretty neat'' to meet the President who had ordered him into battle. Of course, he conceded, a bullet in the chin the first day of the invasion was ''kind of a rough way'' to earn the honor. President and Mrs. Bush traveled early this morning from their house in Houston, where they are spending the New Year's weekend, to San Antonio to visit some of the American servicemen wounded in the Panama attack. Their eyes brimming with tears at moments, they spent about an hour and a half talking to 27 servicemen at Wilford Hall and 17 more at Brooke Army Medical Center. Language of the Troops ''Semper Fi,'' Mr. Bush said to Sergeant Johnson, ellipsizing the Marine Corps slogan. The sergeant was lying in bed in standard-issue blue pajamas. ''Best of luck to you,'' the President went on. ''It was a great operation. There are a little post-mortems here and there, but it was a wonderful thing and we're all very, very proud of you.'' The Marine rifleman, flanked by his parents, Mary and Duane, and his beaming fiancee, Laura Smith, replied, ''We're proud to be able to do it.'' Sergeant Johnson, whose jaw was broken by the bullet that hit his chin, also has a gunshot wound in the forehead and a fragment in his left hand. Twenty-three servicemen and three civilians have died in the invasion, which began 11 days ago. Administration officials estimate that about 300 Panamanian troops and 400 Panamanian civilians were killed in the fighting. Casualties of War The Bushes saw all those who remained of the 252 servicemen treated at the San Antonio hospitals. One man's left leg had been amputated; another lost part of his left foot. Another's wounds had left him a paraplegic. President Bush asked the men about their hometowns and how they had suffered their wounds, and he asked if they were coming along all right. ''Where did you get clipped?'' he asked Wallace Brooks, a 19-year-old Army Ranger from Inwood, W. Va. ''Shoulder, sir,'' replied the redheaded private, sitting in a wheelchair with his arm in a sling. After his visits, an emotional Mr. Bush praised the ''gutsy, courageous young men'' and said he had ''tried to tell them how grateful we are.'' And What About Noriega?  Mr. Bush was asked what message he had given the wounded about Manuel Antonio Noriega, the Panamanian leader who eluded American troops to seek sanctuary in the Vatican diplomatic residence. ''We can tell them he's not out threatening the lives of Americans,'' he replied. ''That's a good message.'' Barbara Bush told reporters the story of one soldier, a paraplegic as a result of his wounds, who gave her husband a small American flag and said it was from all the Americans who had fought in Panama. ''I want you to have this from them,'' the soldier told the President, according to Mrs. Bush. ''And we thank you for sending us.'' Mrs. Bush had first urged her husband to tell reporters the story, but he refused. ''You tell them,'' he said to his wife. The President concedes that he has a hard time expressing emotion in public but that he cries easily when moved. He considered the moment too charged to talk about it calmly before the assembled television cameras. ''I'm not too good at that kind of thing,'' he said today. He tried to talk about a little girl he had met in the hospital, but broke off in midsentence, his eyes glistening. Pleasantries in Two Languages In a ward at Brooke Medical Center, the President had asked Noella Almeida, the 8-year-old daughter of Sgt. 1st Class James Almeida of Taunton, Mass., if she had had a good Christmas. ''Yes,'' replied the child, standing beside the bed of her father, who suffered multiple fragmentation wounds. ''What was your favorite present?'' the President asked. ''My daddy,'' Noella replied. About two dozen protesters lined the motorcade route to Wilford Hall holding signs that read ''No more Vietnam,'' ''Get out of Panama,'' and ''Bring Our Men and Women Home.'' Mr. Bush said the invasion would serve a purpose because ''the country will get some idea of the kinds of kids we've got in the service.'' ''The country,'' he added, ''is behind what you did.'' Asked before the President's arrival how he felt about the Panama invasion, Sergeant Johnson said: ''That's what we do for a living. That's our job. I'd have liked to stick around and not get shot. It's history and I had a small part in it.'' Wounded and Proud In the same room at Wilford Hall with Sergeant. Johnson and his family was the family of Army Sgt. David Reeves, 25, of Woodstock, Ga., a Ranger who had gunshot wounds in both shoulders and a purple Heart on his pillow. Alan Reeves, the soldier's father, cried as he told the President, ''We're proud of the training they've gotten and the opportunity that they have had to serve their country. It just makes tears come to our eyes for what they have done.'' Speaking to Violetta Burgess, the Panama-born wife of Sgt. Roy Burgess of LaBelle, Fla, Mr. Bush asked about the invasion, ''Do you think we did the right thing?'' Mrs. Burgess smiled and nodded. Then he tried out his Spanish on her.''I habla a little espanol, poquito,'' he said, asking her husband, ''Does she have familia'' still in Panama? At that point, Mrs. Bush interrupted to note, ''She speaks perfect English. We don't want to hear George's Spanish in public.''\n",
            "doc 12: The old, worn wooden stands that surrounded Bill Coleman did not appear as they will Monday night, when the painted faces arrive, the lights go on, the bands begin to play, the Orange Bowl comes alive, and a lifetime of memories, joyous or painful, will be compressed into 60 minutes of football. A warm afternoon sun made those lights unnecessary today as Coleman, a senior offensive tackle at the University of Colorado, stood on the grass in his black and gold uniform and surveyed the place he had waited so long to see. The Fighting Irish of Notre Dame (11-1), the opponent of the top-ranked Buffaloes (11-0) in the Federal Express Orange Bowl game, were elsewhere. There was no sign of Ernest Evans, who under the professional name of Chubby Checker will share the stage with Garfield the Cat and a collection of dancing elephants, among others, in a halftime pageant that is enchanting or interminable, depending on the eyes of the beholder. 'Dreams Start to Come True' But there was that sign at the base of the upper level of the north stands: ''THE CITY OF MIAMI WELCOMES YOU TO THE ORANGE BOWL.'' ''It's weird to be here,'' Coleman said as he looked all around, ''seeing your dreams start to come true.'' Colorado's dream has endured through an autumn that included the painful loss of Sal Aunese, the quarterback who died Sept. 23 as a result of complications from stomach cancer, not long after writing a letter that ended by urging his teammates to ''bring home the Orange Bowl.'' The dream came within reach on the afternoon of Nov. 4, when the Buffaloes defeated Nebraska, the goal posts collapsed in Boulder, and all those T-shirts went into production with their message of anticipation: C.U. in Miami. Consider the Possibilities Since then, Notre Dame's school-record winning streak of 23 games came to an end when the Fighting Irish were humbled by the Miami Hurricanes. That result, coupled with the end of Alabama's perfect season the following week at Auburn, created at least two possibilities: A victory by the Buffaloes in the 56th Orange Bowl, completing the only undefeated season of a major-college team this year, would reduce the final news-agency polls to a confirmation of Colorado's first unofficial national championship. A Notre Dame victory would complete what could become the most unpredictable New Year's resolution to a college football season since Jan. 2, 1984, when the University of Miami jumped from fifth place to first in the Associated Press poll of reporters and broadcasters with its 31-30 victory over Nebraska. Monday night, the Miami fans who booed Notre Dame when the Irish were introduced at a Miami Heat basketball game last week will be placed in the personally distasteful position of wanting - and needing - the Irish to win. Fans Across the Nation For a little more than three hours, there will be Notre Dame fans from coast to coast. At New Orleans, the Hurricanes, ranked second in the news-agency polls and first in The New York Times's computer ranking ahead of Colorado, Notre Dame and Michigan, will meet Alabama in the Sugar Bowl while hoping their most bitter rival wins in their home stadium. At Pasadena, Calif., the Michigan Wolverines, ranked third ahead of Notre Dame in the news-agency polls, will oppose Southern California in the Rose Bowl and then seek the necessary assistance of Notre Dame and Alabama, which could complete the first national championship of the Bo Schembechler era in his final game as coach. Here, however, Colorado fans will hope their season ends with a victory of force over the democratic process. ''Everybody else has to speculate about the voters,'' said Bill McCartney, the coach of the Buffaloes. ''For Colorado, our prize is right there.'' The Buffaloes, their few serious injuries behind them, prepared excitedly. The Irish, their shaken confidence compounded by the uncertainty of physical and academic problems and a final-examination schedule dictating that most of their preparation would have to take place here, have worked diligently, if uphill. Andre Jones and Bob Dahl, two defensive linemen who were substitutes prior to the season before the transfer and academic ineligibility of others made them starters, will not play because they missed practices to complete academic work. Donn Grimm, a linebacker who became a starter after the all-America Michael Stonebreaker was placed on university probation, is expected to start despite an ankle injury. Tough Task for Defense The depleted defense will have to cope with a Colorado offense that was second in the nation with a rushing average of 371.8 yards, and committed 13 turnovers, the second-lowest total in the country, despite the risks of the option game. More than 54 percent of Colorado's third-down plays needed 5 yards or less for a first down, and the Buffaloes were successful on each of the 30 third-down plays on which they needed 1 yard to maintain possession. The recording of Lou Holtz's private scenario by a Denver television station led to the controversy that made the Notre Dame coach the focal point of the week. Holtz was asked if it would be fair to say he had been distracted or preoccupied by the attention. ''Definitely,'' he said. ''I think that would be the greatest understatement since George Custer said, 'They looked like friendly Indians.' '' More pressing is the possible limitation of Raghib Ismail, the Notre Dame sophomore flanker and kick returner who has been recovering from a partly dislocated left shoulder.\n",
            "doc 13: The Soviet nation bid an ambivalent adieu to 1989 in midnight revels, joining President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in expressing regret over the ''bitterness'' of the withered economy while hailing the ''waves of revolutionary renewal'' that have tattered the Kremlin's Eastern European bloc. ''The country has lived through a difficult year, the most difficult year of perestroika,'' the Soviet leader conceded, speaking of his troubled restructuring program in his New Year's address even as he gratefully cited 1989 as ''the year of the ending of the cold war.'' On a snowless night in Moscow, there was celebration even in scarcity -with shampanskoye, the gassy, factory-produced sparkling wine. But the people managed sufficient joy to gather and shout, dance and embrace in squares, apartments and nightclubs that thundered with dancing and electronic music the way people here prefer: super-loud and nonstop. The Choreography of Corks In Red Square, and by the turreted twists of color rising spotlit above St. Basil's Cathedral, Muscovites danced in circles and popped corks into a night sky that seemed ablaze with optimism. The eerier symbols of state gaiety, strings of bright white holiday lights, had been carefully put into place to outline the hulking gray centerpiece buildings of the bureaucracy centered on the square. The ordinary people of this anxious nation milled about, in warm contrast to Lenin's Tomb. As ever, they looked within to find strength in family love and romantic pairings, decreeing in kisses and songs that the cares of tomorrow wait until the night was done. ''The 1990's promise to become the most fruitful period in the history of civilization,'' said Mr. Gorbachev, who attempted to explain the season of political rebellion that swept across Poland, East Germany, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia and Rumania as ''the necessity to combine socialism with democracy.'' ''Whatever the aspect, joyous or bitter, the times turn to us and our kith and kin,'' the Soviet leader told his people, hailing the democratization achieved this year. Thorns in the Rosebush He did not mention looming issues like his defense of the Communist Party's monopoly on power. This political monopoly has been systematically discarded elsewhere as East bloc reformers take power from the Communists. Instead, he hailed the big picture, in which ''the postwar division of the continent recedes into the past.'' ''Every person shoulders part of what the entire country is experiencing,'' Mr. Gorbachev said in urging another year of support and labor for his five-year-long leadership. He tersely summarized the ''complexities and political passions'' of the Soviet Union in 1989: growing labor unrest, separatist political agitation, revived ethnic tension and violence, and a consumer market he conceded was more ''aggravated'' than ever. Throughout the day, crowds gathered in slow lines at stores rumored to have scarce soap, coffee or chocolate. Mandarin oranges, a special seasonal treat, were available in some markets at three times the price of a year ago. With the Government once again desperately promising to regear its economic program to get consumer goods into the empty stores, shortages across the nation were being described as the worst in decades. In Sverdlovsk, the scarcity of state-store alcoholic drinks for the new year caused black-market price increases of 500 percent, and finally a traffic-blocking protest on Friday by a crowd demanding the ouster of party leaders. The Party Still Delivers The more fortunate families had the zakaz, the special bonus food baskets offered at factories and offices, arriving through the ubiquitous Communist Party patronage funnel. A housewife here returned from a chaotic, largely fruitless day elbowing through the public markets, where prices were ''frighteningly expensive'' - only to find that her husband had received a zakaz of one fish, two chickens, some cheese, a canned ham and sausage. ''Oh, so much!'' she exulted, looking forward to sharing this with friends at a midnight feast. Amid food and drink, they paid thoughtful attention as Mr. Gorbachev appeared on television in the dying moments of 1989. At another party, a bibulous celebrant retold the latest Gorbachev joke: that his Politburo underlings' New Year's gift to him was chocolate-flavored shoe polish, the better for boot- licking. Television on New Year's Eve offered fast-forward summaries of the year's events, the death of Andrei D. Sakharov racing nightmarishly toward the execution of President Nicolae Ceausescu of Rumania. Dressing the Part There was a dreamy side: in the annual fashion show, presided over by Vyacheslav Zaitsev, a durable, effervescent designer who reigned as well in the political ''era of stagnation'' and is now favored by Raisa Gorbachev. He displayed frocks priced close to the average Soviet worker's annual salary and exuberantly predicted that 1990 would be rewarding for the more style-minded comrades. As the year ended, the frocks were gone and Mr. Gorbachev appeared on television, directing his immmense self-confidence like a spotlight toward the unknowns of 1990 and asking the most basic help from his people.

''They ran us down from behind and from every place else,'' the West Virginia coach, Don Nehlen, said after Clemson capitalized on four second-half turnovers to take a 27-7 victory over the Mountaineers. The Clemson linebacker Levon Kirkland said the Tigers' speed overwhelmed West Virginia, frustrating the Mountaineers' quarterback, Major Harris, who committed all four turnovers. ''He really hadn't seen speed like we had,'' Kirkland said. ''We weren't playing Harris, we were playing the whole team.'' Harris was intercepted once and he lost three fumbles, the last fumble being recovered in the end zone by Clemson's Chester McGlockton for a touchdown that gave the Tigers a 24-7 lead with 8:08 remaining. ''I hurt the team,'' Harris said in the quiet West Virginia locker room. ''I made a couple of key mistakes. It's really hard for you to drive down the field against a team like Clemson.'' Chris Gardocki's second field goal of the game, a 24-yard kick with 3:16 left, completed the Clemson scoring. ''I don't think I can be disappointed with any phase of our football team,'' the Clemson coach, Danny Ford, said. ''I think we made Harris have some nervous feet and we didn't allow him to use the sideline as well as he has in some games this year.'' Joe Henderson and Wesley McFadden also scored on short runs for Clemson, which closed out a 10-2 season with its fifth consecutive victory and fourth consecutive bowl victory. The Mountaineers fell to 8-3-1, losing their third straight post-season game. It was the first time the two schools met on a football field. A Gator Bowl-record 82,911 spectators watched Clemson bounce back from an early 7-0 deficit to dominate the Mountaineers and prevent a bowl-game sweep by major Eastern independents. Syracuse, Pittsburgh and Penn State have all won bowl games this month.\n",
            "doc 15: There seems to be no escaping the long arm of Madison Avenue. Advertisers have now found a way to intrude electronically into people's lives while they browse in shopping malls or wait for buses or trains. Millions of travelers waiting for trains in Philadelphia and Chicago, for example, now get the latest news, weather and sports - along with advertising - from video monitors that hang from ceilings or protrude from train station walls. The newest transit video network is now being installed in the PATH rail system, which shuttles 200,000 passengers daily between New Jersey and Manhattan. Three dozen 35-inch-screen monitors are already up and running in the World Trade Center station and the installation of the remaining 130 monitors in 12 PATH stations is scheduled to be completed by the end of this month. Video in the New York Subways In addition, the company that installed and operates the video systems, Metro Vision Media Network of Syracuse, has been in touch with the New York Transit Authority about setting up a similar system in the New York subways. Metro Vision also operates video systems at bus shelters in Syracuse; Columbus, Ohio; Rochester, and in Long Beach, Calif. And if those buses and trains happen to be taking people to a shopping mall, consumers may soon find more flickering video monitors waiting for them when they get there. A closed-circuit television network is being installed in shapping malls across the country by Mall Vision, a joint venture of the Pioneer Electronic Corporation of Japan and the United Artists Entertainment Corporation. On dozens of television monitors scattered throughout malls, shoppers will be able to watch and listen to programming about food, exercise and health. Of course, there will also be advertising, for local stores, big retailers like Sears and J. C. Penney and fast-food chains like Wendy's. Plans for 50 Malls So far, Mall Vision is only operating in a shopping mall in St. Petersburg, Fla., but the company plans to have the system set up in at least 50 malls nationwide by the end of next year. Mall Vision gains the right to operate in malls by paying the owners of the shopping centers a percentage of the advertising revenues it collects. Metro Vision's transit video systems are also a boon to cities and government agencies. Metro Vision pays for the installation, which costs $3 million in the PATH stations, for example. And the revenues are shared. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey will get about 12 percent of the revenues and expects to make at least $500,000 during the first year, said Armando Arrastia, a spokesman for the Port Authority. Transit officials can use Metro Vision to alert riders about schedule changes and delays. ''It's working very well for us,'' said Terry Hocin, a spokesman for the Chicago Transit Authority. ''We've been able to quickly alert people to any problems and interruptions in service.'' Computer-Generated Images Unlike the more standard television broadcasts used by Mall Vision, the Metro Vision system relies on computer-generated video images. There is no sound, as yet, and instead of moving images the monitors picture a changing series of still images that look much like small billboards. Advertisers are attracted to video systems for several reasons. ''People waiting for a bus or a train are a truly captive audience,'' said Al Babinicz, the president of Metro Vision. What is more, video advertising is far more intrusive than billboards or posters, which have been the standard ways to advertise in malls, at bus stops and in train stations. ''This appeals to us because it isn't stagnant and people are almost forced to pay attention,'' said Barbara Willis, a spokesman for Newport Center Malls, a Jersey City shopping complex that is running ads on Metro Vision's system in PATH stations. The relatively low cost is an added incentive. An advertiser on Metro Vision's PATH network pays $6,000 a month for an advertisement that appears at least 140 times each day. Quick Changes in Messages Another advantage over billboards is that advertising can easily be changed on the Metro Vision systems. Because the transmission is computer-driven, Metro Vision can quickly alter the messages. Newport Center Malls, for instance, recently changed its ad to promote a special concert at the shopping complex and then switched back a day later to a more general message. ''All it took was a quick phone call,'' Ms. Willis said. ''Once you put up a billboard, it's very expensive and time-consuming to change.''\n",
            "doc 16: A group headed by Peter V. Ueberroth, the former commissioner of baseball, and Thomas Talbot, a California entrepreneur, has bought control of Hawaiian Airlines for $37 million. The deal, announced Friday, gives the Talbot Group 85 percent of the common stock of HAL Inc., the Honolulu-based holding company for Hawaiian Airlines and the West Maui Airport. Mr. Ueberroth and John H. Magoon Jr. were named co-chairmen of HAL. Mr. Talbot was named president and chief operating officer. Mr. Ueberroth led a group that tried to buy Eastern Airlines earlier this year for $464 million. That deal collapsed amid objections by Eastern's unions to a continued role in the company for Frank Lorenzo, chairman of the Texas Air Corporation, Eastern's parent company. Mr. Ueberroth's first job after college was as operations manager, and later vice president, of a small airline in Hawaii. Hawaiian Airlines serves the five Hawaiian Islands and 14 cities on the Pacific Rim, including Los Angeles, Seattle and Anchorage. The 60-year-old airline's fleet of 31 planes carried 5.5 million passengers in 1988. HAL reported a loss of $13 million in the first half of 1989 and $30.6 million in the last two and a half years.\n",
            "doc 17: With the impasse over the fate of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega entering its second week, the new President of Panama and his Attorney General disagreed today over whether to file charges against the deposed strongman or leave the question of his prosecution to the United States. The split, reflected in contradictory statements by President Guillermo Endara and his newly named Attorney General, Rogelio Cruz, came on another day of seemingly fruitless talks between American officials and representatives of the Vatican. General Noriega has been holed up at the Vatican mission here since Christmas Eve. In Houston, where President Bush is spending the New Year's holiday, the President declined to comment on the Panamanian disagreement. Impractical, President Says Attorney General Cruz announced that his office might try to indict the general on charges of murder and drug trafficking, a step that could involve asking the American authorities to keep the general in what he called preventive detention. Mr. Cruz suggested that he might seek to file charges as early as Tuesday and that the charges could relate to the killing of at least 10 military officers who sought to topple General Noriega on Oct. 3, including the uprising's leader, Maj. Moises Giroldi Vega. But soon after Mr. Cruz spoke, President Endara dismissed the idea of Panama prosecuting the ousted dictator as impractical. The problem, Mr. Endara said, is that while Panamanians want General Noriega punished, the country has not had enough time to rebuild its criminal-justice system after the United States military strike on Dec. 20. The American assault swept away the staffs of virtually all of the Noriega-dominated institutions of government. ''I hope,'' Mr. Endara said, ''that the Pope does not put us on the spot'' by agreeing to an arrangement under which the general would be handed over to Panama for prosecution. 'Only Fair and Right' There were unconfirmed reports this morning that negotiators had hammered out a solution that would involve a third country taking custody of the general. Asked about the disagreement in Panama, Mr. Bush, who had just visited Americans wounded in the invasion, said: ''It doesn't help you all for me just to speculate on this, but we want him brought to justice. It's only fair and right for these kids lying here that that happens, and I'm determined to see that that happens. So we'll keep working the problem. But I can't help you, because it's just a lot of diplomatic effort going on.'' Vatican officials have been saying for days that an arrangement under which General Noriega is sent to a third country would be the most practical solution to the impasse. Panamanian officials said they were unaware of any breakthrough. But word began circulating today that American military officials had begun preparations to designate a pool of reporters to cover a major development at the papal mission. The United States Embassy in Panama has refused to discuss the progress of its talks with Vatican representatives. Last week, Bush Administration representatives said that while they were still hopeful of gaining custody of General Noriega, they thought his future was increasingly likely to be determined by the Panamanian Government. Division Within the Church President Bush, calling General Noriega a ''narco-terrorist'' and a common criminal, has been insisting that he be turned over to the American troops ringing the mission, while Vatican officials continue to argue that there are political considerations that prevent them from doing that. The differing official views over what to do with the general came a day after a division became apparent within the Roman Catholic Church. Panama's bishops urged the Pope on Saturday to hand over General Noriega for trial in whatever country the Government judged appropriate. The various perspectives seem to reflect the deepening legal and political complexities of the situation that the ousted dictator created when he appeared, clad in rumpled fatigues, at the door of the papal mission last Sunday and asked for political asylum. Although some Panamanian officials brushed off the disagreements this weekend as of little consequence, others said they feared the developments were a sign that the diplomatic standoff, which the Pope's chief spokesman said last week could well end in ''a few days,'' might go on for weeks. 'Off the Top of His Head' Mr. Endara, discussing the Attorney General's statement about General Noriega, said: ''We told the Pope that we have no possibility of giving him due process. We have no Supreme Court, no judicial process.'' Later, a senior aide to President Endara dismissed the Attorney General's suggestions today as something ''off the top of his head'' that had not been discussed in advance with Mr. Endara. The two officials are former law partners, although Mr. Cruz is a political independent and Mr. Endara a member of the Authentic Liberal Party, the party that won the election that General Noriega annulled this year. Some members of the Endara Cabinet have expressed distrust of Mr. Cruz because of his past associations with Ricardo de la Espriella, a former President who was installed and later removed by General Noriega. Few officials here were willing to wager against the possibility that Mr. Endara's thinking on the subject would again shift on short notice. Reversal Pleases U.S. In the course of less than seven days, the new President has gone from flatly opposing the extradition of General Noriega to favoring his arrest by the United States. His reversal last week, which pleased American officials, came in a letter to Pope John Paul II dated Thursday. Mr. Endara told the Pope that the best solution would be for the Papal Nuncio to deny General Noriega further sanctuary so that ''on leaving the nunciature, he would be in the hands of the troops of the United States of America, who would guarantee his security and, presumably, bring him to justice.'' On the same day the Pope's chief spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said, ''taking into account international law and accepted procedure, I don't see how the nunciature can hand over someone'' to a government other than that of the host country. Although President Endara said he would expect General Noriega to be tried ''for the common and despicable crimes for which he is accused in our country,'' Panamanian officials have made it clear that there are no formal charges pending. #3,000 Detainees Freed So far the only official charges against General Noriega are money-laundering and drug-trafficking accusations included in Federal indictments issued in February 1988 by two Federal grand juries in Florida. A senior United States Embassy official said last week that among the more than 4,000 people arrested by United States forces in Panama since the Dec. 20 invasion, a large number had been arrested at the specific request of the new Government, although in the absence of indictments. The official said that by late last week more than 3,000 of the detainees had been released after pledging their loyalty to the new Government. Officials said 1,347 prisoners are being held a a detention camp near Rodman Naval Station, at the Pacific terminus of the Panama Canal. A handful of prisoners, including several former top Noriega aides, were flown to Miami last week to face charges growing out of the indictments handed up there. About 40 other Noriega loyalists, men the American Embassy official described as ''the real bad guys,'' were being held at an American military base here for interrogation, processing and probably future trials.\n",
            "doc 18: With demand outstripping capacity and freight rates rising, the new year might seem ripe for a flood of orders for new bulk-cargo ships - a flood reminiscent of those in the early 1970's and the early 1980's. But that will not be the case this time, many people in the industry say. Instead, some experts and executives say, the emphasis in the next few years will be on finding ways to extend the life of the current fleet of freighters and tankers. ''The world will have to be content with the existing fleet of elderly ladies - warts, face lifts and all,'' said Basil Papachristidis, the chairman of Papachristidis Ltd., a major shipping company in London. Recalling a Mistake of the Past There are a number of reasons. Shipowners worry about repeating a mistake of the past: ordering new ships when cargo rates were rising only to have them delivered when the market had softened. Lenders have made credit more scarce because many businesses have grown more reluctant to sign the long-term contracts that help guarantee a loan will be paid off, and because state subsidies for shipyards are falling. Also, new ships have become much more expensive, and the capacity to build them has been cut so drastically that even the modest amount of current orders has filled up the leading shipyards. As a result, shipyard capacity is expected to become even tighter in the coming years, industry executives say, and shipping rates are expected to continue to go up. Another possible result, some industry people said, is an increase in spills and accidents that accompany the aging of the fleet, although most large spills have been caused by human error on newer tankers and ships. Higher Prices Are Expected With the emphasis switched to maintaining the existing fleet, the value of ships is rising, leading to speculation and the buying and selling of many ships. ''The squeeze is on,'' said Michael S. Hudner, president of B & H Ocean Carriers Ltd., at a recent conference on shipping at the American Stock Exchange. ''In the next two to five years, you are going to see a big increase in the price of ships.'' The Greek family that owns Tsakos Shipping and Trading is typical of many shipowners. Nikolas P. Tsakos said his company, which owns its own shipyard, could easily begin building new ships now that there has been a strong recovery in shipping rates. Instead, he said, the yard in Uruguay is mainly being used to overhaul and upgrade some of the existing fleet of 35 ships. ''We believe we can do well by maintaining our second-hand vessels,'' he said. Because such attitudes prevail, shipyard capacity is expected to grow by only about 2 percent in the next two years, Ocean Shipping Consultants reported. But demand for bulk shipping is expected to grow by about 2.5 percent. What is more, as the proportion of older vessels increases, the time consumed by breakdowns and overhauls rises, making capacity even tighter and raising rates. Michael G. Jolliffe, the chairman of Global Ocean Carriers Ltd., said rates for bulk ships have been rising steadily. As an example, he said, one of his company's bulk carriers, the Global Star, had been chartered at $13,500 a day but would be re-chartered at $14,500 a day. But many people in the industry think shipping rates will have to rise 40 to 60 percent before shipowners feel confident enough to place large orders for new ships. 'It's Too Risky' Shipowners recall that in the past big orders were placed in the middle of an upswing in cargo rates and the ships were delivered several years later, when the industry was in a recession. ''You can't order now and get a ship a year from now,'' said Roberto Giorgi, a managing director of V. Ships, a large shipping company. ''If you order now, it's delivered in 1992 or 1993. It's too risky.'' He and other shipowners cite the example of the Sanko Steamship Company, a Japanese shipping concern that was forced to seek bankruptcy protection in 1985. The company, an operator of large tankers, with 263 vessels, had ordered about 150 new ships during the upturn that began in 1980, only to have most of them delivered after shipping rates had fallen. Another reason for the slow growth in new orders, Mr. Papachristidis said, is that banks were more generous with credit in the past because businesses often agreed to long-term charter rates for a new ship. The long-term rates guaranteed a certain revenue even when spot rates fell and helped assure the owner and the bank that the cost of the ship could be paid off. Uncertainty About Rates Now, because of greater uncertainty about the course of rates, businesses are more reluctant to lock themselves in for 10-year agreements. What is more, governments in nations like Japan and South Korea have reduced or eliminated subsidies for shipyards, vastly increasing the cost, and therefore the risk, of ordering new ships. Some industry people predict that many of the reclusive families that own important shipping companies will therefore be forced to disclose their finances and operations to attract capital from the public markets. ''The older generation resists, seeking to keep it in the family by inheritance and marriages,'' said Costas Grammenos, a professor specializing in shipping at the City University Business School in London. ''A large percentage of the new generation have studied the industry and favor a different approach.'' He said younger members of ship-owning families who favor a more open and modern company might be in conflict with their more conservative elders. Time-Consuming and Expensive Even if money can be raised to order a new ship, building it has become more time-consuming and expensive. Shipyard capacity has shrunk by about 60 percent in the last decade. The capacity that exists has been filled with orders, mostly for large tankers. A new ship can therefore not be delivered until about two to two-and-a-half years from now. Employment at Japanese shipyards, which produce about half the world's ships, has shrunk to 34,000 from 150,000 in 1975, with many workers moving to high-technology industries. So it could be difficult to find skilled workers quickly to reopen a mothballed shipyard. In the United States, there is not much shipyard capacity left for building commercial ships. Joachim Chao, a director of Global Ocean Carriers, a shipping company, said the Japanese have little incentive to increase capacity and instead are seeking to drive up prices to be able to make a profit. ''They are not going to repeat the mistakes of the past,'' he said. $85 Million Tankers Falling state subsidies, rising labor rates, general inflation and tightening shipyard capacity have all contributed to a large increase in the price of cargo ships. But while the price of a large tanker has risen to about $85 million, from half that amount 10 years ago, the Japanese yards are still unable to make a profit. Vincent Cannaliato Jr., a senior vice president at the investment firm Smith Barney, Harris Upham, estimated that the true cost of such a tanker was $115 million and that the shortfall was being made up by state subsidies in Japan. Thus, some industry experts and executives predict that the emphasis in the next few years will be on finding ways to extend the life of the existing fleet. It could cost $200 billion to overhaul the world's shipping fleets in the next decade, said Mr. Grammenos of the City University Business School. Some industry people worry that as ships age the risk of spills and accidents will rise. But many shipowners say the life of bulk ships, normally about 25 years, can safely be extended to 30 years with proper maintenance. But the task will not be easy, because some of the most vulnerable parts of a ship are hard to reach. Investing in Ships There is also concern about whether companies that still want long-term charter agreements will accept them for older ships. The lack of surplus shipyard capacity has stimulated the formation of new shipping companies that exist primarily to capitalize on the rising value of current ships rather than to operate ships long term. Mr. Jolliffe of Global Ocean Carriers estimated that the six bulk-cargo vessels that the company bought with a public offering for $46.7 million in 1988 have appreciated to $55 million.\n",

            "doc 20: HE tugged at the Los Angeles Raiders cap snug atop his head and his eyes shifted as if he were anticipating a blitzing linebacker. Darian Hagan, a teen-ager laden with adult-like responsibility, was explaining in his own way how he became a man so hurriedly, so unexpectedly. ''Growing up in Watts is like a universe of its own,'' said the 19-year-old Hagan, who is the Colorado Buffaloes' quarterback. ''I was around gangs all the time at school, on the streets. Some of my cousins were in gangs. My friends got shot. But I was in sports early and I always tried to keep a straight head. ''The gangs never bothered me. They even had videotapes of my games. When you grow up in something like that and it becomes normal, it makes you a man a lot faster. You have to grow up fast just to survive. It's helped me to handle what has happened here. My home and Boulder have forced me to become a man real fast.'' Hagan was sitting near the Colorado locker room after a practice last week, a few days before the team left Boulder for Miami and the Orange Bowl. He acknowledged there had been plenty for him to handle in Boulder: the social changes involved in traveling from the predominantly black Watts district of Los Angeles to predominantly white Boulder; his request to be moved to running back last year after his first Colorado season; Sal Aunese's illness with stomach cancer and death, which prompted Hagan's ascension to the starting quarterback job this season; Colorado's 11-0 season and its No. 1 ranking, and Hagan's fifth-place finish in the Heisman Trophy race won by the Houston quarterback, Andre Ware. And now this: the battle tonight with formidable Notre Dame (11-1) in the Orange Bowl and a shot at Colorado's first unofficial college football national championship. While other Colorado players speak of the great honor they feel just receiving the chance to play Notre Dame, Hagan characteristically differs. ''I talked a lot and bragged a lot in high school and when I first got here, but I've learned a lot about humility,'' he said. ''So, I don't want to sound too harsh, but honestly, the privilege in this game is Notre Dame's. We're undefeated.'' With his soft round face, saucerlike eyes and quick smile, Hagan looks like the boy next door who is always outside catching a ball or shooting a basket. One visit with him reveals a hint of mischief and his street savvy. And one look at him on a football field cracks any doubt about his ability. Through its 12 games this season, Notre Dame has not met a quarterback who possesses the skill and electricity of this 5-foot-10-inch, 185-pound sophomore. This season, Hagan became the Big Eight Conference's first quarterback to rush for 1,000 yards and pass for 1,000 yards in one season and only the sixth player in National Collegiate Athletic Association history to accomplish the feat. He is a speedy option quarterback who zigzagged into the end zone 17 times this season. He threw for four more touchdowns and completed 56.5 percent of his passes. He was a shocking 100 percent in converting all nine of Colorado's two-minute drives this season into points, six times into touchdowns. And for good measure, he has become the new focus of the Buffaloes' spirit, a leader among young men who are almost all older than he is, if not wiser. ''Knowing he is back there, we as offensive linemen feel the big play is inevitable,'' said Bill Coleman, a senior tackle. ''If he gets that one step, he's gone. The next time we see him, we're all in the end zone jumping up and down with our bellies hanging out.'' In many ways, Hagan is similar in style to Tony Rice, the Notre Dame quarterback. The two met in New York at the Heisman Trophy ceremonies last month. ''We seemed to act the same and have a lot in common,'' Hagan said. ''The things he said I said. The things he did I did. I think he's down to earth and levelheaded like I am. He invited me up to his room and we talked a long time. We talked mostly about girls. I think we'll watch each other closely in the Orange Bowl, because we both want to perform at a peak. ''It's kind of funny. Notre Dame recruited me and wanted me to be a returner. They were going to use me a lot like they use Rocket Ismail. But I wanted to play quarterback. Colorado gave me that chance, and now I get to show Notre Dame firsthand what I could have done for them.'' It was also Aunese's death that gave Hagan his chance. Had Aunese, entering his senior year, lived, Hagan would likely have been an obscure figure on what some believe would have been an obscure team. Hagan doesn't share that view. ''I believe we would have gone undefeated with Sal, too,'' he said. ''Sometimes I feel guilty about getting to start this way. I mean, to get to start after a death of your teammate is not the way you want it to happen. I go out there thinking of Sal every game like everyone on this team does. But once the game starts, I've been able to put it behind me.'' Hagan credits Gary Barnett, the Colorado quarterbacks and running backs coach, with advising him on ''life in Boulder,'' how to conduct himself in interviews and how to accept his opportunity. ''Boulder can be a racist town,'' Hagan said. ''I learned if someone makes a racial slur how to turn your head and go. Where I come from, you don't turn your head, you fight to the end. In that way, I'm a totally different person.'' Hagan's only previous taste of post-season play was in the Freedom Bowl after last season, when he entered late and failed miserably in a 20-17 loss to Brigham Young. His only pass was intercepted and led to B.Y.U.'s winning field goal. He ran six times for only 10 yards. Hagan was so shaken after that game that he asked Bill McCartney, the Colorado head coach, to switch him to running back. McCartney allowed him to run a few plays at running back in early practices last spring, but the coach says now that he never planned to give up on Hagan at quarterback. Now that Hagan has led Colorado this season to victories over Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas and Illinois, he is thinking only of success against Notre Dame. ''I'm a competitive guy and I'm going to fight to the end and be poised,'' Hagan said. ''I'm going to be a leader. I've got toughness. I know how to rise from the bottom when things don't go right. When we struggle, I take it upon myself to make myself the option, to do something extra with or without the ball. I know in a lot of ways I'm still just a kid. But in a lot more ways, I'm a man.''\n",

            "doc 22: There is still a lot of the professor in Jacques Delors, the 64-year-old president of the European Commission, the European Community's excutive branch. But unlike most professors, Mr. Delors, who used to teach at France's elite Ecole Nationale d'Administration, has the opportunity so see much of his vision transformed into reality. Mr. Delors, an intense, almost driven man, is fascinated by monetary and economic matters, and has used his command in those areas to help implement his vision. When he took the helm of the European Commission in 1985, he made removing internal trade barriers with the community his No. 1 goal. Now many people say there is a good chance that he will succeed in his goal of toppling those barriers by the end of 1992. In 1989, Mr. Delors embraced a new goal to build on the previous one: he wants to create a single European central bank and a single currency, moves that he says are necessary to gain maximum benefit from a united Europe. His frequent rival, Britain's Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, along with many economists derided this notion as pie in the sky, saying it required far more abandonment of sovereignty than many nations would accept. Despite the odds, Mr. Delors scored a major victory in December by helping persuade the leaders of the 12 community nations to call a special conference next year where they will consider changes in the community treaty to allow for creation of a single central bank. Mr. Delors, who was France's Finance Minister from 1981 to 1984, is not totally consumed by community activities. He goes to church every Sunday, and keeps active in France's Socialist Party, some say with the hope of becoming France's Prime Minister or even President some day. Mr. Delors says his Catholic and Socialist impulses pushed him to call for a ''European Social Charter,'' a document establishing minimum rights for Europe's workers. Mrs. Thatcher was again his principal foe on this issue, but again he racked up a big victory in December, when 11 of 12 community leaders approved the Social Charter. Mr. Delors joined the Bank of France at the age of 20, and developed his economic expertise while working there, much of it through reading. He remains an avid reader, spending his vacation last summer reading about what basic notions tie Europeans together. That reading came in handy because the leaders at last July's economic summit conference in Paris, recognizing the growing importance of the European Community, decided that the community should coordinate the West's aid efforts to Eastern Europe.\n",
            "doc 23: Israel paid thousands of dollars in cash to Nicolae Ceausescu for every Rumanian Jew he allowed to emigrate for two decades, an Israeli newspaper reported. Mr. Ceausescu received $5,000 to $7,000 for every visa issued to Jews, and $50 million to $60 million ended up in the President's pocket, the paper, Yediot Aharonot, said in its weekend edition. Mr. Ceausescu was executed on Christmas Day after a brief trial by a Rumanian revolutionary tribunal. Quoting what it said were eliable sources, the paper said agencies responsible for immigration in Israel, including the Foreign Ministry and the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency, acknowledged that Mr. Ceausescu had been paid but would not give specific figures. Discreet Silence Suggested Israeli officials reportedly knew of the payoffs for years, but they dared not publicize it for fear that it the flow of emigrants from Rumania would be halted, the paper said. ''Our interest was the protection of the Jews in Rumania and not what kind of dictator Ceausescu was,'' it quoted an unidentified official involved in the deals as saying. According to the report, the money given to Mr. Ceausescu was raised by various Jewish organizations. It said reliable American Jewish informants had confirmed that he received the money for the last 20 years. The English-language Jerusalem Post said the money was handed over in suitcases filled with United States dollars. Flow of Migrants About 400,000 Rumanians have emigrated to Israel since its founding in 1948 and 1,500 each year for the last 10 years. The head of the Immigration Committee in Parliament, Michael Kliner, told Yediot Aharanot that helping bring Rumanian Jews to Israel meant saving lives, and therefore ''all necessary steps were kosher.'' A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Motti Amichai, said the ministry knew of no such deals with Rumania. Repeated telephone calls to the spokesman for the Jewish Agency went unanswered.\n",
            "doc 24: A few seconds before midnight, the chief priest of a small hilltop sanctuary known as Sengen Shrine fidgeted in his scarlet robes and looked nervously at his watch while listening to the radio for the electronic beep signaling the arrival of the Year of the Horse. Japan may take the coming of the New Year more seriously than perhaps any other country in the world, having long ago adapted the Chinese cycle of years to the Western lunar calendar. The result this morning was a national ritual combining a Times Square-like countdown and Eastern mysticism. When the moment came, for example, Norihumi Kitagawa, the chief priest, banged the big loud drum at the shrine's entrance, and several hundred people surged forward under the stars. Old Lucky Charms Discarded The worshipers in front tossed coins into a box, clapped and prayed silently for good fortune, while those at the rear bundled together in the cold near a huge bonfire consuming piles of good-luck charms from last year that had been discarded earlier in the evening. ''It's not necessarily a religious occasion,'' admitted Mr. Kitagawa, who is the fifth chief priest in his family to serve as head of Sengen Shrine. ''People just want to taste the feeling of the new year, join with the crowd and visit this shrine.'' All over Japan, the new year was rung in this morning in ways particular and also universal. The celebrations were said to be more exuberant than those last year, when spirits were dampened by the freezing, wet weather and the failing health of Emperor Hirohito, who died on Jan. 7 after a long illness. The National Police Agency estimated this week that about 80 million Japanese, or two-thirds of the nation's population, would be praying at roughly 1,200 shrines and temples this weekend in the nation's biggest annual display of religious and secular fervor. Twenty thousand people were said to be climbing mountains in honor of an old tradition holding that such places were the habitats of the gods of the Shinto religion. The Neighborhood Shrine Here in the capital, about five million people were expected to travel this weekend to the immense and ornate Meiji Shrine, once again making it the most popular New Year's spot in Japan. But most Japanese go to the shrines in their own neighborhoods, like Sengen Shrine, in an upper-middle-class area of southern Tokyo. ''The motivation of Japanese at New Year's is complicated,'' said Takao Sofue, a professor of anthropology at the University of the Air in Tokyo. ''Some people go because they really believe in the Shinto religion. But probably most just want to do something exciting and new that will refresh their minds.'' At Sengen Shrine, on a wooded hill overlooking the Tama River, worshipers spoke of a variety of motivations for making offerings this morning. ''We're praying to pass our exams in school,'' said Tomo Takahashi, a 15-year-old student, as his friends nodded. ''Of course, you have to study every day, but passing exams is also a matter of luck.'' His friend, Kei Inoue, had a more mundane wish. ''I just broke up with my girlfriend,'' he said. ''I'd like another girlfriend soon.'' A few steps away a group of teen-age girls looked over at the group of boys. Asked what they were wishing for this year, they burst into giggles. ''Love, love, love!'' came the replies. The First Prayers of 1990 First to offer prayers in the seconds after the New Year was drummed in this morning were members of the Yumoto family. They had been trying for three years to arrive at the shrine early enough to be first in line. ''Now maybe some good fortune will come,'' said Kaneo Yumoto, an automobile mechanic. After people offered prayers, they went to a counter to buy good-luck charms, including little boxes with paper streamers that told their fortunes. If the fortunes were unsatisfactory, they tied the streamers to the pine and bamboo trees surrounding the shrine. Then they stood in line again to drink steaming bowls of sweet, milky sake as they stamped their feet in the cold. Mr. Kitagawa said thousands of people from all over the area come to this little shrine, but the shrine regards only about 3,000 families as hard-core members and donors. The Business Advantage For any shrine, New Year's time is also important for business, because the purchases of charms and trinkets supply a large portion of income for operations, including upkeep and payment to the priest and his family. Sengen Shrine prepared for this evening for two months. A few days ago, Mrs. Kitagawa's friends came to help her clean the offices, while the men swept the surrounding area. A few steps away, a professional calligrapher was chain-smoking while delicately brushing the names of the donors on to other strips of paper to be hung outside the shrine. ''The main function of the shrine nowadays is to teach young people about Japanese traditions,'' said Mrs. Kitagawa, pausing between chores. ''Before, people used to live in big families and didn't need to learn. Now that old family system has been destroyed.'' Guidance for Young People Indeed, even the articles in Japan's magazines and newspapers about the New Year's holiday were instructing young people on how to visit a shrine. One monthly magazine told its young readers that they had to be respectful in making the trip. Using terms with which readers might be familiar, the magazine told younger readers that just as they would not wear dirty jeans to an interview for a job or university, so they would not want to dress disrespectfully at a shrine. ''Before praying to the gods or Buddha,'' the magazine said, ''dress tidily, wash your hands and rinse your mouth just as you would before going out on a date.'' #800 Years of History Sengen Shrine is thought to have been founded in the 12th century by Masako Hojo, wife of the first shogun of the Kamakura Era. According to legend, she was traveling near the Tama River to visit her father and spotted a little hill, where she decided to rest. At the top of the hill, Masako Hojo was amazed to see a commanding view of the plains leading up to Mount Fuji. Convinced that this inspiring view would bring luck to her husband in his battles for supremacy, she donated a Buddha to the spot and established a shrine. On the wall of Sengen Shrine are oil paintings depicting it in its sylvan days, surrounded by woods and fields. Today, one can look across the Tama River at apartment complexes and a steel bridge carrying a noisy commuter train to Yokohama. ''Japan is becoming known around the world as a prosperous country,'' Mr. Kitagawa said. ''But through all these ceremonies, we wish the people of the world would know that Japan is a country of many traditional ceremonies and also a country of God.''\n",
            "doc 25: President Daniel Ortega Saavedra said today that the ransacking of the Nicaraguan Ambassador's residence in Panama by American troops on Friday has brought Nicaraguan-American relations to their deepest crisis in 10 years. But the Nicaraguan leader insisted that his Government's decision to retaliate by expelling 20 American diplomats was a moderate response. And he and other Sandinista officials suggested that they were eager to head off further diplomatic reprisals that could lead to a complete break in relations between the two countries. Late Friday, the Nicaraguan Government ordered the Americans, including most of the American Embassy's senior political officers, to leave the country within 72 hours. But they took no action against the embassy's charge d'affaires, John P. Leonard, and avoided forcing the American mission to close down, which would carry far more extensive political and diplomatic consequences. As American diplomats prepared to leave the country today, there was no indication whether the United States would try to retaliate against the Nicaraguan Embassy in Washington, or whether it would avoid an escalation that could force the closing of either embassy. Such diplomatic warfare has already left representation between the two countries at the minimum. In statements today, Nicaraguan officials asserted that the search of the Nicaraguan Ambassador's residence was intended to provoke the Government into taking similar action against the homes or offices of American diplomats here, and then to use that response as a pretext for direct military action to topple the Nicaraguan Govrnment. ''I can say, responsibly, that on Dec. 29 we were at the point of a truly fateful military showdown between the United States and Nicaragua,'' Mr. Ortega said.\n",
            "doc 26: The collapse of the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association produced an array of victims, from retired California investors who bought unsecured bonds to American taxpayers. But it also turns out that not all the investors in the failed institution were losers. Thanks to a Reagan Administration policy intended to bolster the savings industry, the Bankers Trust Company was able to sell hundreds of millions of dollars of the savings unit's best assets for the benefit of foreign financial institutions six days after the savings institution was seized by Federal regulators, executives who were involved in the deal said. The sale took place even as confused Federal regulators were trying to secure those same assets, regulators and Government documents contend. This lawful transaction is but one piece in a complicated financial structure erected by Charles H. Keating Jr., the chairman of Lincoln, and respected financial institutions with help from the Federal Government. Bankers Trust itself has not been charged with any improper dealings. Thomas A. Parisi, the bank's senior vice president for corporate communications, in response to questions from a reporter, wrote that the bank's dealings were proper but that the company's ''policy of confidentiality regarding its customers' business with the bank precludes my responding to your other questions.'' Institutions Protected But the story of Bankers Trust's relationship to Lincoln, pieced together from regulators' accounts and public documents, illustrates how the Government tried to help the savings and loan industry and how institutions can protect themselves against the risks small investors run. The Government's help came in the form of the informal regulatory policy to assure Wall Street firms that sold securities issued by savings institutions, like Lincoln, that the investors' money would be readily available. In contrast, Lincoln branches were permitted to sell to small customers bonds that were uninsured and unsecured. So far, a House Banking Committee inquiry and other investigations into the collapse of Lincoln have concentrated on Mr. Keating, whose American Continental Corporation took over Lincoln in 1984, and the five Senators and numerous lawyers who interceded with regulators on his behalf. Under Mr. Keating, Lincoln, which is based in Irvine, Calif., started making a series of investments in real estate and risky high-yield securities, which regulators were questioning. The cornerstone for Lincoln's expansion after Mr. Keating took it over was an infusion of large brokered deposits for which Lincoln paid high fees to brokerages - in addition to the interest rates paid to depositors. Only two years later regulators were concerned that the savings and loan's ''dependence upon expensive brokered deposits,'' which were being placed by some of Wall Street's largest brokerages, could be a serious drain on the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, which insured the deposits up to $100,000, according to examination reports on Lincoln. In the first six months, the largest source of deposits, almost $200 million, was Merrill Lynch, documents show. Later, when Merrill stopped placing new deposits, Dean Witter became the largest source, some $671 million, a 1987 examination report states. Abnormally High Fees Examiners said that the fees paid the brokerages by Lincoln were abnormally high, for example 2.86 percent in the case of Dean Witter. Spokesman for both firms said their fees were in line with industry practice. These deposits financed Lincoln's risky investments, many of which were transferred to various subsidiaries. One such subsidiary was the Lincoln Finance Corporation, or Linfin, which was set up in 1985 and soon received some $300 million in questionable mortgages and securities from Lincoln, according to documents. Around the same time Linfin sold $275 million in Eurodollar notes, the proceeds of which were transferred to Lincoln for various uses. The notes were secured by mortgage-backed securities first owned by Linfin, then Lincoln. The payment of interest and principal for most of the securities was guaranteed explicitly or implicitly by the Federal Government. This kind of transaction, perfected by investment firms that underwrote the securities, was a common form of growth for the savings and loan industry in the 1980's. The Linfin note was underwritten by some of the same firms that brokered deposits into Lincoln, like Merrill Lynch, according to Lincoln's offering circular and Federal examination reports. Additional Leverage The 1986 examination report of Linfin said that the Eurodollar notes, one of a number of such offerings by Lincoln, represent ''additional leverage through off-balance-sheet financing.'' Typically the investors are large European companies and institutions attracted by the high quality of the Government-guaranteed collateral, and by the fact that in the Eurobond market investors are generally able to remain anonymous. The trustee chosen by Lincoln for the various foreign notes was Bankers Trust, which had a variety of other financial dealings with Lincoln, acting, for example, as a clearinghouse for electronically transferred funds. Bankers Trust's reputation as a trustee for these kind of deals was good, according to documents and brokers. Important to Investors The Government policy that insured the liquidity of these kinds of notes was important to investors. Under that policy, Federal regulators in the Reagan Administration promised that in the event of a takeover or bankruptcy filing, the Government would relinquish its claim on the underlying collateral and allow investors or noteholders to take possession, bankers and regulators say. Lawrence J. White, a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board from 1986 until earlier this year, said that the board, in adopting this policy, tried to be ''sympathetic'' to savings and loans and their need to grow, since giving investors first claim meant the savings units could sell the notes at a lower cost. That was the plus. ''The minus,'' Mr. White said of the Government's decision to subordinate its interest in the assets, ''was that in the event of an insurance action, what was left was crummy assets.'' The policy presents a risk for the insurance fund, Mr. White said, and he now thinks savings and loans should pay for that in the form of a premium. Confused Regulators As the Federal insurance fund took control of Lincoln in April, regulators were ''confused'' by Lincoln's finances, according to Jill Spencer, general counsel of the Federal Home Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, which supervised Lincoln. Ms. Spencer said the home loan bank wanted the mortgage-backed securities held by Lincoln, but pledged to Linfin note holders, as ''additional collateral'' for hundreds of millions of dollars in advances the San Francisco bank had made to Lincoln. Five days after Bankers Trust liquidated the securities for the benefit of the noteholders, the bank was still talking with regulators about the collateral. But, Ms. Spencer said, the bank ''sort of gave up on this collateral'' and turned to other collateral instead. Millions Transferred A few days before the Government took over Lincoln, millions of dollars were also transferred out of Lincoln to Bankers Trust, said a House Banking Committee investigator who asked not to be identified. A former regulator, who also asked not to be identified, said there were so many wire transfers between Lincoln and Bankers Trust that it took several days to straighten them out. Committee investigators want to know what happened to the money and whether the electronic withdrawals made Lincoln short of cash. The committee is also interested in the relationship between Lincoln and a senior vice president of Bankers Trust, Barbara Thomas, who was a commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission from 1980 to 1983. She joined Bankers Trust in 1986. The executive also had personal financial dealings with Lincoln and lobbied Federal regulators on the savings institution's behalf. 'Unique Repayment Terms' When Ms. Thomas, who was in charge of international private banking, went to borrow money from Lincoln, she received what the Banking Committee chairman, Henry B. Gonzalez of Texas, called ''unique repayment'' terms. According to committee aides, Ms. Thomas has borrowed $250,000 under a 1987 unsecured line of credit that requires no payment of principal until the credit line expires in 1990. Between 1986 and 1989, Ms. Thomas made several approaches to Federal regulators on Lincoln's behalf, including an unsuccessful attempt in 1986 to obtain confidential examination data about the savings and loan, according to testimony before the Banking Committee. She may have also received consulting fees from Lincoln. Bank examination reports show that examiners questioned a number of undocumented Lincoln consulting arrangements, including one for $100,000 in 1987 for a ''B. Thomas.'' Ms. Thomas was not available to talk with a reporter, Mr. Parisi, the Bankers Trust spokesman, said.\n",
            "doc 27: Morocco appealed for help today in its struggle to keep a 230-square-mile oil slick away from its coastline and to halt the spill that began when an Iranian tanker was damaged in an explosion nearly two weeks ago. The edge of the oil slick was 17 miles from shore when the Government issued its appeal through the official Moroccan press agency. An explosion on Dec. 19 aboard the Iranian tanker Kharg-5 tore through its hull as the ship sailed north of Las Palmas in the Canary Islands. The cause of the explosion is unknown. A subsequent fire forced the 35 crew members to abandon ship, and the vessel and its leaking cargo began drifting toward northwest Africa. Morocco appealed to Britain, France, Spain and Portugal for help in cleaning up the 37 million gallons of oil that spilled from the tanker and formed the slick, the news agency said. France Sending Experts The French Government said it would send a team of experts led by Brice Lalonde, its Secretary of State for the Environment, to evaluate the spill and recommend action. The ship was floating today about 45 miles off the Moroccan city of Safi, south of Rabat. Specialists were trying to plug the gash in the hull. The Moroccan press agency warned that an ''ecological catastrophe'' would result if the slick reaches land and that potential damage to fishing stocks, tourism and other coastal industries could cost 100,000 people their jobs. The Government of King Hassan II formed a council to deal with the crisis, but its experts have had little success in dispersing the slick, the press agency said. 27,000 Tons of Oil RABAT, Morocco, Dec. 31 (Reuters) - A spokesman for the Casablanca port authority said that about 27,000 tons of oil had spilled from the Iranian tanker and that oil was still leaking from the vessel. The Moroccan press agency said that the Spanish vessel Pointa Salenas was seeking to disperse the slick with 6,600 gallons of chemicals. Morocco has ordered another 10,500 gallons of chemical products. It said that the tanker was no longer burning. Casablanca maritime radio reported that seven tugboats from Morocco, Spain and West Germany had tried to tow the vessel to Cadiz in southern Spain or to Casablanca, but that heavy seas had snapped their tow cables. In Paris, Jacques-Yves Cousteau, the French oceanographer, said that damage to the environment could even exceed that caused by the oil spill from the Exxon supertanker Valdez earlier this year. ''We must do something. We must send experts. This is a disaster for Morocco,'' he told French television. ''An ecological catastrophe of the first magnitude happened on Dec. 19 and it is only on Dec. 31 that people begin to take notice,'' Mr. Cousteau said. The Exxon Valdez spilled 11 million gallons of oil when it ran aground in Alaska's Prince William Sound in March, fouling more than 1,000 miles of shoreline.\n",
            "doc 28: Senator Sam Nunn, the leading Democratic figure on military issues on Capitol Hill, says the United States should seek deeper cuts in American and Soviet troop strength in Europe than the Bush Administration has proposed in arms negotiations. Mr. Nunn, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, suggested a reduction from the current American strength of 305,000 Army and Air Force troops to about 200,000 to 250,000. The Administration has proposed a troop limit of 275,000 as part of a treaty cutting conventional forces in Europe. The Georgia Democrat's comments on troop cuts are part of a broader recommendation that the United States redefine the overseas role of its forces by concentrating on air power while cutting costly Army troops stationed around the world. How Far Should Cuts Go?  Mr. Nunn elaborated his views, which are likely to be influential in Congress's budget deliberations, in a recent interview on a broad range of security issues. His comments come at a time when both Congressional Democrats and the White House agree that reduced tensions between Moscow and Washington and the need to cut the Federal deficit will force sizable reductions in military spending. But how far the cuts go and what programs are reduced loom as potential points of conflict between the White House and Congress. Several weeks ago, Mr. Nunn criticized the Administration for failing to revise its military planning in light of the recent political changes in Eastern Europe and a reduction in Soviet military forces there. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney disputed that criticism, and some Pentagon officials have challenged members of Congress to define their own strategy. Reserving Judgment on Specifics In the Dec. 22 interview, Mr. Nunn insisted that he wanted to reserve judgment on many of the specifics, pending hearings by his committee on the new Pentagon budget, the changing threat to the United States' national security and the development of a new military strategy. The hearings are to begin in the third week of January. But he did say that the United States should move to a revised military role for Western Europe in which it would ''specialize'' in air power while requiring the Western European allies to assume more responsibility for ground defense. Expanding on this point, Mr. Nunn said President Bush's proposal, made at the NATO summit last spring before the upheaval in Eastern Europe, ''has been overrun by events'' and should be revised. The proposal would set equal limits of 275,000 on American and Soviet troops in Europe and would result in a 30,000 cut in American Army and Air Force troops and a cut of about 325,000 in Soviet troops in Europe. Mr. Nunn said the 275,000 ceiling would ''validate'' a higher Soviet military presence in Eastern Europe than East Europeans want, indeed higher than Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev himself may now be prepared to accept. In addition, he said budget pressures are driving the United States to make deeper troop cuts in Europe. It is far from clear that Moscow would go along with Mr. Nunn's suggestion since Soviet officials have objected to the idea of confining troop limits to American and Soviet forces. Moscow has proposed that troop limits be set on all NATO and Soviet-bloc forces stationed on foreign soil. Pacific Force Cuts Suggested In the Pacific, Mr. Nunn advocated a ''partial, gradual draw down'' of American troops in South Korea, adding that the United States should maintain the capability to use air power there. Senator Nunn also said the Bush Administration should consider withdrawing some American forces from Japan. Senator Nunn also said Western European nations and Japan must assume a greater burden for defending the sea lanes from the oil fields in the Persian Gulf to their countries. He urged the United States to buy more of its oil from South America, which would enable Washington to concentrate more of its military resources on the Western Hemisphere. But while Senator Nunn is urging a rethinking of American military deployments around the world, he is not reconsidering some crucial and contentious programs that he has long supported. He indicated, for example, that he still strongly supports the idea of developing a ground-based interceptor to knock out incoming missile warheads launched by accident or by hostile third world nations. Such a system would be different than the space-based ''Star Wars'' anti-missile defense proposed by President Ronald Reagan, which was intended as a shield against a full-scale Soviet attack but which has encountered major technological, political and legal obstacles. The Senator said such a ground-based system should be deployed if it was determined to be technologically feasible and if the costs were not too great even though the deployment might require renegotiation of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviets. That agreement sharply restricts the deployment and testing of anti-missile systems. Senator Nunn first suggested such a system two years ago but it has received little support outside conservative circles. Support for Stealth Bomber And echoing Air Force arguments, Mr. Nunn said he still strongly supported the program to build the costly Stealth bomber, in part, because the weapon could be used to elude air defenses on missions in third world countries. Critics say the United States does not need a sophisticated bomber like the Stealth to carry out such attacks and have questioned whether Washington would actually employ such a costly plane in that situation. In other comments, Mr. Nunn, who plans to visit Panama early this week, said the Bush Administration's decision to attack Panama to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega was ''justified.'' But he criticized the Justice Department for indicting Mr. Noriega on drug charges during the Reagan Administration, saying that this complicated efforts to remove the Panamanian strongman from power. The Senator said the American attack ''is not something that was inevitable.'' He continued: ''It could have been handled in a different way, starting a couple of years ago. And I'm sure the people of Panama would have been better served had it been. They suffered economically and they are going to continue to suffer economically.'' Turning to strategic issues, Senator Nunn said the United States and the Soviet Union need to review thoroughly their procedures for the firing of nuclear-tipped weapons to protect against an accidental launching of the weapons and to identify other possible deficiencies in the command and control systems. If the Pentagon did not carry out a ''total review of our fail-safe systems from one end to the other, under independent and objective people,'' Senator Nunn said he would order his committee staff to do their own review. Efforts to Cut U.S. Troops The Senator's call for shifting emphasis in overseas deployments from ground troops for air power is likely to buttress what has been a somewhat tentative effort by the Congress to reduce America's troop presence abroad. Earlier this year, Representatives Patricia Schroeder, Democrat of Colorado, and Andy Ireland, Republican of Florida, successfully sponsored legislation to cut the American military presence in Europe by 15,000. They prevailed by arguing that the reduction would merely remove the troops used to operate the intermediate-range missiles eliminated under the 1987 American-Soviet missile accord. But an effort by Senators Dale Bumpers of Arkansas Democrat and J. Bennett Johnston of Lousiana, both Democrats, to cut 10,000 of the 43,000 American military personnel in South Korea was unsuccessful. Pressures on Congress The pressure in Congress to cut deployments is likely to be stronger in the coming year because many members of Congress view it as a more attractive way to save money than closing bases at home. In addition, the Army has drawn up plans to refashion itself into a fast-reaction force that would be largely based in the United States, adding to the emerging consensus for cuts in overseas deployments. For his part, Senator Nunn urged that the United States redefine its overseas role for defending Western Europe to make the most efficient use of its military resources. He said Washington should inform its NATO allies that ''what we are going to be evolving toward will include U.S. strengths, and our strengths don't include getting a huge number of heavy forces to Europe during an emergency,'' referring to armored and mechanized Army divisions. ''Independent of Gorbachev, we should have been putting more emphasis on air power and on light mobile forces.'' Senator Nunn said future military budgets are likely to reflect a 2 to 5 percent decrease after inflation is taken into account. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have told Mr. Cheney that the $180 billion in cuts from projected spending increases that the Pentagon is considering are the most they can tolerate. But the Senator said he could not identify a minimum level of acceptable military spending, saying that the pace of Soviet weapons production will have a strong bearing on Congressional deliberations. ''We should look at bottom lines on capabilities, not in terms of dollars,'' he said. ''Each new weapon system needs to be revalidated versus the threat and versus changes.''\n",
            "doc 29: The Devils led, 3-0, midway through the game tonight but sagged badly in the second half as they lost to the Detroit Red Wings, 6-4. Detroit scored five unanswered goals in the third period to drop the Devils to a .500 record (18-18-4) as New Jersey reached the midway point of the 80-game schedule. The Devils led by 1-0 after one period and by 3-1 after two. In the third period, Detroit got goals from Steve Chiasson, Rick Zombo, Mark Habscheid, Lee Norwood and Gerard Gallant. Chris Terreri played in goal for the Devils, who were outshot, 17-8, in the second period and by 20-3 in the third period. Aaron Broten scored twice for New Jersey and Patrik Sundstrom and Kirk Muller scored once each. The Devils' next game is Tuesday night, at home, against Buffalo. A Classy Crowd The game was played before a loud and festive capacity crowd of 19,875 at Joe Louis Arena. New Year's Eve games are a tradition in Detroit, this being the 35th in a row. Some of the fans, perhaps en route to further festivities, came dressed in tuxedos, furs and evening gowns. The first period, a brisk one, ended with the Devils leading, 1-0, after Patrik Sundstrom's 15th goal of the year. Sundstrom, skating in on a two-on-one with John MacLean, took an airborne right-to-left pass from MacLean and knocked it out of the air, past Glen Hanlon, the Detroit goalie, at 10:48. The pass floated over the outstretched stick of the defenseman Steve Chiasson, who dived across the front of the crease in an effort to break up the play. The highlight of the period was the goaltending of Hanlon, who stopped 11 shots, including two by Brendan Shanahan and Sundstrom on a shot-and-rebound volley. At the other end, Chris Terreri, the Devils' goalie, dealt with only six shots in the period. Detroit's Daniel Shank hit the goal post with a backhand on a rebound. Detroit had an edge in shots and overall play in the second period, but it ended with New Jersey leading, 3-1. Broten Ends Dry Spell Broten gave the Devils a 2-0 lead at 1:06 of the second when his low slap shot went in after being slightly deflected by the stick of Borje Salming, the Detroit defenseman. It was Broten's first point in eight games. He hadn't had one since he scored a goal Dec. 15 against Los Angeles. He got his second goal of the night at 10:43, while the Devils were short-handed. His slap shot from the circle to the right of Hanlon was partly stopped but trickled between the goalie's pads to make the score 3-0. At this point, the home fans began to jeer their goaltender, cheering sarcastically when he made routine saves. This stopped shortly thereafter when Detroit got one back at 12:26 to cut the lead to 3-1. Scoring was Shawn Burr, who stood in front of Terreri, fought off a checker and tipped in Mark Habscheid's long wrist shot from near the left boards. Late in the period, Terreri brought a loud groan from the crowd with a sprawling leg save on Burr, who was set up in front.\n",
            "doc 30: A new wheel for cyclists has bypassed conventional spoked designs in favor of aerodynamic blades. Specialized Bicycle Components, a firm based in Morgan Hill, Calif., developed the wheel with engineering expertise from the Du Pont Company of Wilmington, Del. Mark Hopkins, a senior engineer at Du Pont and co-inventor of the wheel, says that each blade is shaped to behave like an airfoil. By reducing wind resistance, the bladed wheel has 'one-third less drag than a conventional spoke wheel,' Hopkins said recently. His performance claim is based on wind tunnel tests. The bladed wheel is designed for road bikes. It is made with a foam core and molded with Kevlar, a Du Pont material known for its strength, and carbon fiber in an epoxy resin. The rim is aluminum. The composite wheel weighs about the same as a spoked wheel. Although the wheel was still in its development stages when the Ironman Triathlon World Championship took place last October in Hawaii, designers predict that the bladed wheel will show up in the Ironman next year. Hopkins estimates that a bicycle with the new wheel can shave 10 to 15 minutes from the best time for the 112-mile Ironman bicycle competition. The Specialized wheel is expected to be available in bike shops by early March. It will cost about $750 (for one wheel).\n",
            "doc 31: An angry rebuke from Coach Roy Williams was all Kansas needed Saturday night to pull away from previously unbeaten Stanford and post an 83-61 victory in the final of the BMA Holiday Classic. With 7 minutes 42 seconds left, Kansas had let a 19-point lead dwindle to 62-49, and Williams called his team to the sideline. ''When he calls time out, it's when he's mad,'' said Jeff Gueldner, a forward. ''He's seeing something we've got to change. We weren't playing smart. We were playing careless, throwing balls away.'' From that point on, Kansas went on a 19-8 run and Stanford scored only 12 points the rest of the game. ''I challenged them,'' Williams said. ''That's not the way we're supposed to play when we throw the ball away without looking and try to force passes inside.'' Gueldner and Kevin Pritchard scored 15 points each for the Jayhawks (13-0). ''Kansas is everything I thought they would be,'' said Coach Mike Montgomery of Stanford (8-1). ''They don't make mistakes and they capitalize on your errors.'' Free Throws Save Duke HONOLULU (AP) - Duke relied on free throws to hold off Hawaii and win the championship of the Rainbow Classic, and that was just fine with Coach Mike Krzyzewski. ''Our free-throw shooting has been fantastic all year,'' Krzyzewski said after Duke won the title with an 87-75 victory. ''Down the stretch we did what we wanted to do and really didn't let them get back in it.'' Chris Gaines's 3-pointer pulled Hawaii to 80-75 with 1:06 left. The Rainbows then repeatedly fouled Duke, which went 7 for 8 from the foul line during the closing minute. Gaines led Hawaii with 26 points and was named the tournament's outstanding player. Duke (8-2) used a strong inside game led by Robert Brickey, Phil Henderson and Alaa Abdelnaby to defeat Hawaii (11-2), which was playing in front of its first sellout crowd since 1982. Earlier, Cincinnati defeated Rutgers, 79-71, for third place. Oklahoma Winners OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - Oklahoma was held under 130 points for only the second time this season but Tony Martin scored 27 points and sparked big runs in each half that carried the Sooners to a 99-78 victory over Tulsa and the championship of the All-College Tournament. Martin, named the tournament's most valuable player, scored 5 points in an 11-0 first-half run that gave the Sooners (8-0) their largest lead of the half, 36-22, with 5:28 left. Then, after the Golden Hurricane (6-4) scored the first 5 points of the second half to get to 50-45, Martin scored 8 in a 16-4 spurt that gave the Sooners a 66-49 lead. Tulsa got no closer than 12 after that. Tulsa's deliberate style and tough defense held Oklahoma well below its nation-leading average of 137 points game. But the Sooners frustrated Tulsa with a zone defense that helped turn the game around. Oregon St. Wins Again PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - Nobody in Memorial Coliseum had any doubt who would be named the most valuable player in the Far West Classic. Gary Payton, who is used to making the big plays for Oregon State, did it for the second night in a row Saturday as the Beavers won by 71-68 for their third straight classic title. The playmaker scored 30 points, including a pair of game-clinching free throws with six seconds to play. Payton, who also had 13 assists, was named the tournament's most valuable player for the third year in a row as Oregon State won the championship for the 18th time in the event's 34-year history. ''His quality to pass the ball and see the court is outstanding,'' the Oregon State coach, Jimmy Anderson, said. ''I've said before he's a genius on the floor, being able to manipulate and not only see one open man, but three or four.'' The Beavers (9-2) never trailed and led by as many as 15 points in the second half. But Oregon (7-4), which has never beaten the Beavers in nine attempts in the tournament, rallied to 69-68 on two free throws by Mike Helms with 45 seconds to play. After Earl Martin of Oregon State missed the first of a one-and-one free throw opportunity with 36 seconds remaining, Oregon's Terrell Brandon drove the lane but missed a layup. Richard Lucas of Oregon grabbed the rebound, but Payton got his hands on the ball and the officials called a jump ball with seven seconds to play. It was Oregon State's turn to get the ball out of bounds. Payton was fouled on the inbounds play and, with six seconds left, sank both halves of a one-and-one situation to clinch the victory. Alabama Rolls SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) - Alabama outran and outclassed two opponents in the Cable Car Classic, but it didn't stop Coach Wimp Sanderson from worrying as he looked ahead to Southeastern Conference play next week. ''We did win two games, but we're not very close to where we need to be,'' the coach said after the Crimson Tide (9-2) downed Santa Clara, 64-48, in the championship game. ''I'm not at all happy with our rebounding.'' Despite beating Iona and the Broncos by a combined 55 points, Alabama was outrebounded in the tournament and used fast breaks and timely 3-point shooting to turn the games into routs. Melvin Cheatum scored 20 points and Keith Askins hit four 3-pointers in a second-half runaway against Santa Clara (3-8). In the consolation game, Shawn Green and Joey Johnson scored 20 points each and Iona survived Penn's furious second-half rally to earn a 52-49 victory.\n",
            "doc 32: The Rev. Jesse L. Jackson said yesterday that the attack on Panama had allowed the Bush Administration to deflect criticism of its secret diplomatic missions to China after the crackdown on demonstrations there. But Mr. Jackson took care to avoid saying that the invasion was motivated by a desire to steer public opinion. ''I am not sure what all the motivation of the invasion was,'' he said. ''I will not engage in that kind of speculation.'' His comments came during a press conference at the Canaan Baptist Church in Manhattan in which Mr. Jackson spoke critically of the human cost of the invasion but stopped short of saying that he opposed it. On Dec. 9, Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, and Lawrence S. Eagleburger, the Deputy Secretary of State, met with Chinese officials in Beijing. The visit prompted accusations that the Administration showed a disregard for human rights. On Dec. 18, the White House disclosed that Mr. Scowcroft and Mr. Eagleburger had also met secretly with the Chinese in July. The invasion of Panama began on Dec. 20. ''We do know that sending the high-level diplomats to China is off center stage because attention has shifted to Panama,'' Mr. Jackson said.\n",
            "doc 33: His friends always said George Bush would be a foreign-policy President, but even they didn't expect this. In bold contrast to his mentor, Ronald Reagan, Mr. Bush has begun his tenure in the White House with a year of deep involvement in events beyond the borders of the United States. By contrast, his attention has seldom been focused for long periods on domestic policy questions. There's no evidence that he planned it that way; events in China, the Soviet Union, Panama, Colombia and Eastern Europe forced his hand. In the first weeks of his Presidency, Mr. Bush seemed determined to resist the magnetism of Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his ideas. Never mind how much the Soviet President and President Reagan had come to trust each other, Mr. Bush told his associates. Never mind the enthusiasm of the press and the academics and the Europeans. We're going to wait until we see real evidence of change in the Soviet Union. That position proved untenable, partly because Washington (and Paris and Bonn and even Rome) took it as a sign of weakness and drift in the White House, and partly because of the pace and degree of change in Eastern Europe (notably, at that stage, in Hungary and Poland) that Moscow was willing to countenance and even encourage. Under attack at home and abroad, Mr. Bush shifted course, or at least tone. First he developed and sold major arms-control initiatives to the NATO allies. Then, in a speech at Mainz, West Germany, on May 31, he moved out of the camp of prudence and vigilance and into that of optimism and movement. Acknowledging Bonn's critical role, he described the United States and the Federal Republic as ''partners in leadership'' of the Western alliance. But the image of innovation rapidly wore thin in a world of breathless change. In the Mainz speech, the President issued two major challenges to Mr. Gorbachev - open the Berlin Wall and promote political pluralism in Eastern Europe - implying that American concessions would follow. By the time Mr. Bush went to Malta to meet Mr. Gorbachev at the beginning of this month, both challenges had been met, and the President was being accused of lacking the vision to cope with the revolutions in East Germany, Bulgaria and Czechslovakia. Once again, he had a series of surprise proposals ready, largely economic, and once again he was able to regain the initiative, at least in part, from the whirling dervish in the Kremlin. Mr. Bush made gestures and concessions to the Soviets, for the express purpose of easing the way for a Government that has been moving, slowly but steadily, in the direction of American ideals and policies. But at the same time he caused widespread resentment by making gestures of reconciliation toward China, in the form of visits from ranking officials of the Administration, before and not after the Chinese gave evidence that they would desist from the repressive policies that led to the slaughter of hundreds of anti-Government protestres in Beijing in June. Finally, just before Christmas, the President committed American troops to their biggest combat operation since Vietnam, sending them to Panama to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and to give a democratic regime there a jump-start. Mr. Bush said in Texas the other day that he was finishing this year on a rather high note. But his moment of satisfaction, however well earned, is likely to be short. As the year ends, the President's capacity to surprise and to act boldly are in no doubt. But the underpinnings of his policy remain unclear. Is he promoting democracy, whose time seems to have come with such a rush? Or is he merely acting in the self-interest of the United States, letting realpolitik lead where it may? The next 12 months will provide further clues on that large question, and perhaps answers to smaller ones: Will the United States, which could muster only an embarrassing $500,000 in medical aid for Rumania, be able to find the large sums needed to help put Eastern Europe back on its feet? Will major troop cuts be negotiated? Will progress toward German reunification or rapprochement be possible without upsetting the stability of Europe? And will George Bush, in 1990, turn to the detailed domestic policies that he avoided in 1989?\n",
            "doc 34: Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today dismissed Science Minister Ezer Weizman from the Israeli Cabinet, saying the influential Labor Party minister had met with leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organization and given them advice on how to thwart a Government peace initiative. Mr. Weizman is an outspoken advocate of talks with the P.L.O. and a former air force commander who helped bring about the Camp David peace agreement with Egypt. He denied that he met with P.L.O. officials. In a television interview today, Mr. Shamir said, ''Mr. Weizman was in contact with the P.L.O., guided them, told them what to do against us and how to act against our peace initiative.'' Effective in 48 Hours Mr. Weizman was given written notice of his dismissal in a letter from Mr. Shamir. But the letter said the dismissal would be effective in 48 hours, leaving open the possibility that a compromise could be arranged to avert a split in the coalition Government. A veteran Israeli politician, the 65-year-old Mr. Weizman has represented several parties in various Cabinet posts since 1969 and is a former head of the air force and nephew of Chaim Weizmann, Israel's first President. His dismissal sent shock waves through the Israeli political world and prompted talk of a break-up of the fragile coalition formed last November between Mr. Shamir's Likud party and the Labor Party. Finance Minister Shimon Peres, the Labor Party leader, said Mr. Shamir's action had provoked ''a very serious crisis.'' ''The Prime Minister must rescind his decision.'' Mr. Peres said. ''We have nothing to compromise about.'' But a top official in the Labor Party said it was unlikely that Labor would immediately withdraw from the Government. Labor planned to meet tonight to discuss its response to Mr. Weizman's dismissal. In the Cabinet meeting today, Mr. Shamir said that Mr. Weizman ''met with an official representative of the P.L.O. in a European state and recently sent messages to the head of the P.L.O., Yasir Arafat.'' Law Against P.L.O. Contacts Under Israeli law, no Israelis are allowed to meet with the P.L.O. or other organizations deemed to be run by terrorists. The Labor Party is deeply divided on whether to try to repeal the law, while Likud and right-wing legislators strongly support it. Mr. Weizman said tonight on the Israeli television that he had met with Dr. Ahmed Tibi, an Israeli Arab doctor who has supposedly been involved in transmitting messages to and from the P.L.O. But the army radio said Mr. Weizman had met with Nabil Ramlawi, the P.L.O. representative in Geneva, a few weeks ago. While refusing to detail Mr. Weizman's activities, an aide to Mr. Shamir, Yossi Achimeir, said there was solid proof of Mr. Weizman's activities. Under the coalition agreement, Mr. Shamir may not dismiss a minister without the consent of Mr. Peres. The Prime Minister said he asked for Mr. Weizman's resignation last Thursday in a meeting with Mr. Peres and informed him of the accusations, fulfilling his obligation. But Mr. Peres said that he never agreed to the measure and that in any case Mr. Shamir should have personally told Mr. Weizman of his plans and met with him. Asked what will happen if Mr. Shamir does not reverse himself, Mr. Peres said that Mr. Shamir ''will have to carry the consequences of his decision'' and that ''it'll be a serious crisis.'' During the last few months, contacts between Israelis and P.L.O. representatives have become a hotly contested public issue. Two months ago an Israeli court sentenced Abie Nathan, a well-known peace champion, to six months in jail for meeting with P.L.O. officials. And two weeks ago, two Arab members of Parliament and Palestinians who live in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip met with Mr. Arafat and briefed Foreign Minister Moshe Arens of Likud on their trip. Mr. Peres today demanded on behalf of the unanimous Labor ministers that Mr. Weizman be reinstated. ''If Mr. Shamir insists on firing Weizman, and the move is carried through, there won't be a national unity Government,'' said Yossi Beilin, the Deputy Finance Minister and a close aide to Mr. Peres. Likud ministers sought to play down the crisis atmosphere. The Minister of Arab Affairs, Ehud Olmert, a close associate of the Prime Minister, said he did not believe that the turmoil would ''yield a real crisis.''\n",
            "doc 35: Steve Spurrier, who won the Heisman Trophy in 1966 as quarterback at the University of Florida, today returned to the school as head football coach after a scandal-plagued decade for the Gators that resulted in the ouster of his two predecessors. Spurrier, who coached at Duke the last three years, agreed to a five-year contract worth an estimated $2 million to take over a program that again is in the middle of a National Collegiate Athletic Association investigation. ''His hiring is another positive sign that our football program is indeed headed in the right direction and the University of Florida will be a program to be reckoned with on the national level during the 1990's,'' the Florida athletic director, Bill Ansparger, said in a prepared statement. Florida offered Spurrier the job Dec. 12, but Spurrier waited until both Duke and Florida completed bowl games before accepting. Duke lost to Texas Tech, 49-21, in the All-American Bowl on Thursday and Florida lost to Washington, 34-7, on Saturday in the Freedom Bowl. ''It's a job I've wanted for a long time,'' Spurrier said. ''This is the place I want to be, the place I should be.'' Spurrier will begin recruiting for Florida while the Gators are under scrutiny of an N.C.A.A. investigation that began June 30. Galen Hall resigned as coach in October after admitting he violated N.C.A.A. rules. The Defensive coordinator, Gary Darnell, served as Florida's interim coach and led the Gators to a 3-4 record after Hall left them at 4-1. The 44-year-old Spurrier played nine years with the San Francisco 49ers and one season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He was an assistant coach at Florida in 1978 before spending a year at Georgia Tech and three at Duke as an assistant.\n",
            "doc 36: As Americans look to the year 2000, most of them anticipate a better life for themselves, but at the same time they foresee a worsening of many of the nation's social and economic problems, according to a new Gallup Poll. Seventy-seven percent of the 1,234 adults polled said they expected the overall quality of their own life to be better by 2000. Similarly, 77 percent anticipated that their family life would be better in 10 years' time. Seventy-four percent said their financial situation would be better. Eighty-two percent of employed adults also predicted their job situation would improve in 10 years. Somewhat smaller majorities of Americans also anticipated that by 2000 people would be spending more time on leisure and recreation (68 percent), and more time with their families (58 percent). A minority said people would be spending more time on jobs (38 percent) or household chores (13 percent). Personal Optimism-Pessimism The poll, conducted by telephone Nov. 16-19, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. The participants' optimism about their own lives was accompanied by a more pessimistic outlook on many current social and economic problems. Large majorities expected by 2000 to see increases in the rate of inflation (74 percent), the crime rate (71 percent), poverty (67 percent), homelessness (62 percent), and environmental pollution (62 percent). Slightly smaller majorities anticipated a worsening of the unemployment rate (59 percent), alcohol and drug abuse problems (58 percent), and the divorce rate (58 percent). Race Relations: A Better Age?  One bright spot concerned race relations. Fifty-two percent of the public expected tensions between racial and ethnic groups to decrease in the 1990's, while 39 percent said such tensions would increase. There was optimism over health. Sixty-seven percent anticipated a cure for AIDS by 2000 and 56 percent foresaw a cure for cancer by 2000. In international affairs, the responses were mixed. On the one hand, 68 percent of Americans expected the Soviet Union and the West to be living peacefully together in 10 years. Thirty-two percent even expected Soviet Communism to have vanished by then (The poll was conducted shortly after the opening of the Berlin Wall). Even Split on Central America On the other hand, the public was divided over whether other international problems were likely to ease or worsen. Fifty percent expected international terrorism to increase in the 1990's, and 40 percent anticipated a decrease. The public was evenly split on whether United States forces would be drawn into military conflict in Central America, 50 percent saying it would happen, 50 percent disagreeing. Only 8 percent foresaw a nuclear war between the Soviet Union and the United States by 2000, but 33 percent expected a nuclear war to be started by a country other than the superpowers. Just 28 percent anticipated peace between the Israelis and the Arabs in 10 years. As for the outlook for energy, the public also had mixed expectations. Approximately two-thirds anticipated that a new, clean energy source would be developed (65 percent) during the 1990s', but nearly the same proportion expected an energy crisis (64 percent). Easier or Harder Life?  The public seemed to view ecological disaster as more likely than economic crisis in the decade. The 34 percent that expected a world economic depression were outnumbered by the 61 percent who said they thought a major change in the earth's climate would come about by 2000. The underlying contrast between personal optimism and social pessimism was evident in the public's judgment about aspects of life that would become easier or harder by 2000. Fifty-three percent expected the l990's to be a decade in which life would get easier; 38 percent expected life to get harder for them, personally. But, on problems facing people more generally, large majorities saw increasing difficulties for many Americans. The public expected it to become harder for parents to afford college for their children (89 percent), harder for people to buy a house (81 percent) and harder for people to afford retirement (79 percent) and medical care (79 percent). Sixty-four percent expected it to become harder for young people to find jobs in the 1990's.\n",
            "doc 37: The debate over how to cut the military budget has been complicated by a confusing array of numbers and budgetary terms. The political battle of words and figures began about six weeks ago when Defense Secretary Dick Cheney ordered the armed services to prepare plans for cutting $180 billion from ''projected spending.'' Then, several military experts from outside the Government declared that the annual Pentagon budget, currently about $300 billion, could safely be cut by half or more over the next decade. That was a critical point in the public debate, but confusion resulted because different sets of figures were quoted. Mr. Cheney was talking about reductions from ambitious levels the Bush Administration projected last summer for the next four years. The outsiders were recommending cuts from current spending levels adjusted for inflation. When a Cut Is an Increase That is why critics like Senator Jim Sasser, the Tennessee Democrat who heads the Budget Committee, weighed in. They said that while the Defense Secretary spoke of cuts, his plan would actually lead to increased military spending and that, as Mr. Sasser put it, ''the peace dividend, as currently constituted, is a rubber check.'' The debate is likely to boil over early in the New Year when as many as a dozen Congressional committees are planning hearings on the issue. To understand the debate, these points must be kept in mind: * Mr. Cheney's figure of $180 billion in cuts is based on cumulative annual reductions in the Administration's original plan for a much expanded Pentagon budget each year through fiscal year 1994. The figure would mean less money than needed to keep up with inflation but a small increase in actual dollars spent each year. * A plan advocated by former Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara and generally accepted by Senator Sasser and others would lower slightly the actual amount of money spent each year and would result in a large reduction below inflation-adjusted figures. It would cut the Pentagon budget by an average of 5 percent a year after accounting for inflation. * The military is not unlike a family: if its budget does not rise enough to keep pace with inflation, its purchasing power is reduced. Starting at the beginning, in fiscal year 1990, which began Oct. 1, the Pentagon's budget authority is $291.2 billion. It plans to spend $288.4 billion. This does not include about $10 billion in the Energy Department for the production of nuclear weapons. Variations in Spending Budget authority, also called appropriations, is the amount of money Congress approves each year. Some of the money is spent in subsequent years. At the Pentagon, nearly all of the budget authority for personnel is spent in the year the money is approved. But only 80 percent of the authority for operations and maintenance, 60 percent of that for research and development and 15 percent of the authority for procurement is spent in that year. As recently as last summer, the Bush Administration was planning on an increase in the Pentagon budget authority of 1 percent more than the amount needed to keep up with inflation in fiscal year 1991 and 2 percent in fiscal years 1992, 1993 and 1994. Based on the way Congress has cut the military budget since 1987, lawmakers were highly unlikely to go along with that ambitious proposal. But nonetheless, military officials based their spending plans on the projection. The actual amount that would have been allocated under this plan would have depended on the rate of inflation. The staff of the House Budget Committee has calculated that with an inflation rate of 4 percent - the approximate rate of the last several years - budget authority for the military would have risen from $291 billion in fiscal year 1990 to $312 in 1991, $329 in 1992, $350 in 1993 and $365 in 1994. Lowered Expectations Because of improved relations with the Soviet Union and budget pressures, Mr. Cheney this fall ordered the military services to develop plans for keeping authority at the same level, $291 billion, through fiscal year 1994. Using different inflation projections from those used by the Congressional staff, Mr. Cheney calculated a cumulative three-year saving from fiscal year 1992 through fiscal year 1994 of $180 billion. It is important to remember that this saving is measured against the increases originally proposed and not against the actual 1990 budget. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have told Mr. Cheney that they could live with his cuts for four years, but that further reductions would undermine American security. The Administration's budget for fiscal year 1991, which begins Oct. 1, is in the final stages of preparation and will be presented to Congress Jan. 22. Officials familiar with the Pentagon budget say Mr. Bush will propose budget authority of about $295 billion and spending of $292 billion. Congress is likely to lower those amounts. Senator Sasser has observed that the $292 billion in spending anticipated by the Administration is about $4 billion more than what is being spent in the current fiscal year and only about $5 billion below what would be needed to keep up with inflation. 'A Mere Fraction' The $5 billion, he declared, is ''a mere fraction'' of the $40 billion in deficit reduction that will be needed to meet the $64 billion deficit target set by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget balancing law. That is apparently why President Bush has made so little of the Pentagon saving. Some people think, he said recently, ''if you cut defense spending by $10 billion, we can take that money and spend it on something else; we can't do that.'' Outside specialists do not disagree with that analysis. But they are looking at the savings many years ahead. Two military experts from previous administrations - Mr. McNamara, Defense Secretary in the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, and Lawrence J. Korb, an Assistant Defense Secretary in Ronald Reagan's first term - told the Senate Budget Committee in testimony this month that the Pentagon budget could be cut in half in constant dollars over the next 10 years. That would mean an average cut of 5 percent a year over 10 years below what would be necessary to keep pace with inflation, not out of line with Mr. Cheney's proposed cuts over the next three years or Mr. Sasser's suggestions for a somewhat longer period. Assuming a 4 percent rate of inflation, an average 5 percent cut after inflation would lead to a Pentagon budget of about $280 billion in actual dollars in fiscal year 1994, or about $230 billion in 1990 dollars.\n",
            "doc 38: The icicles dripping off frozen Florida oranges on Christmas weekend warmed hearts in Brazil, the world's largest producer of frozen orange juice. Brazil supplies about half the orange juice consumed by Americans and accounts for three-quarters of the world market. Bolstered by a record orange crop this season, it stands to profit handsomely from Florida's misfortune. Nationwide, the orange has become such a symbol of easy wealth in Brazil that a popular soap opera, ''The Savior of the Nation,'' is set in two prosperous, although ficitious, Sao Paulo orange-growing towns. The industry's exports are likely to surge this year, perhaps as much as as 36 percent, to a record $1.5 billion, said Jose Carlos Goncalves, president of the Brazilian Association of the Citric Juices Industry. When Florida Froze Before The previous record for orange juice exports by Brazil, $1.4 billion in 1984, was the result of a Florida freeze. Before the Florida freeze, Brazil cut orange juice prices, hoping to increase its market share and dispose of its huge crop. But it suspended export permits on Tuesday, hoping to force up the price of futures contracts for juice concentrate on the New York Cotton Exchange. Of Brazil's predicted production of 900,000 tons this season, about 400,000 tons have been sold, giving growers and processors hopes for a windfall. Prices for frozen concentrated orange juice for delivery in January soared 21 percent during the holiday-shortened four-day trading week, settling Friday at $1.6565 a pound on the New York Cotton Exchange, compared with $1.37 a week earlier. Frost-Free Zone Concentrated largely in the frost-free interior of Sao Paulo State, Brazil's orange juice industry grew in the 1980's to become the source of the nation's third-largest agricultural export after coffee and soybeans, according to the foreign trade department of the state-owned Banco do Brasil. Built on cheap land, labor and a temperate climate, the orange juice industry is a national success story. The first significant exports started in 1962, the year of a Florida freeze. Helped initially with low-interest farm loans, Brazilian orange groves have steadily expanded, to about 175 million trees today from 39 million in 1970 and 106 million in 1980. The 1989-1990 crop - about 280 million 90-pound boxes - is expected to be about s third larger than last year's crop of 210 million. About 85 percent of the national crop is crushed into frozen concentrate for overseas export. Leaders of the Industry The two titans of Brazil's orange juice industry are Sucocitrico Cutrale S.A. and Citrosuco Paulista S.A., which each account for about 28 percent of exports. Other large companies are Frutesp, with about 11 percent of exports, Cargill with about 7 percent of exports, and Montecitrus with 6 percent. In Sao Paulo state, 12 million trees were planted during the last crop year, double the rate of the early 1980's. Three large projects are under way there: Citrol Bartol plans to build a $12 million orange juice processing factory in Bebedouro; Royal Citrus is investing $25 million in a factory in Taquaritinga, and the Votoranti Group plans to plant three million trees and build a $30 million processing plant in Itapetininga. Move to the South Recently, the industry started spreading to areas in Brazil's south. This year, an orange juice concentrate factory opened in Rio de Janeiro state and over the next five years Parana state is to benefit from a $150 million investment in orange plantations and a factory. To sell this growing production, the Brazilians are trying to diversify from their traditional markets, North America and Western Europe, which collectively receive 95 percent of the exports. The best potential market appears to be Japan, which has promised to abolish its orange juice import barriers in 1992. In 1990, Brazil hopes to export to Japan, 23,000 tons of juice, slightly less than 3 percent of total exports. Cargill, Citrosuco and Cutrale are studying the feasibility of building an orange juice terminal in Japan.\n",
            "doc 39: An ancient economics scoring rule is that a session is a failure when the size of the panel exceeds the size of the audience; by that measure, most of the sessions at the annual convention of the American Economic Association here were a success. More than 2,500 economists served as chairmen, paper givers or discussants on one or more of the 472 panels organized by the 41 professional bodies under the umbrella of the Allied Social Science Associations, but they were well outnumbered at the convention, for altogether some 6,550 economists, most of them college professors, descended on this city. Some sessions - like those on the transformation of the Eastern European economies - were so popular that extra loudspeakers and folding chairs had to be set up in hallways. Helping to Offset Complaints The sessions were also a success in hitting most of the major topics of the day, thus helping to offset complaints about the economists' ability to forecast. There were also sessions on the prospects of a peace dividend resulting from the end of the cold war, and on whether the United States is losing out to Japan, West Germany or others because of its declining savings rate. This year's presidential address, prepared by the late Joseph A. Pechman of the Brookings Institution and delivered by his colleague, Henry Aaron, defended the progressive income tax as the most equitable tax, based on the principle of ability to pay. Despite what he called ''an incessant barrage'' from two groups of economists who favor either a spending tax or a flat-rate income tax, Mr. Pechman noted that no country in the world was planning to abandon the income tax or even considering a personal spending tax. He said the wave of change, starting with the Tax Reform Act of 1986 in the United States, that was sweeping the world ''was aimed at improving the income tax, not eliminating it.'' Tax Base Broadened Tax preferences that were once regarded as sacrosanct, he added, were being eliminated and the tax base broadened, thereby making possible steep cuts in income tax rates. ''It will come as no surprise to this audience,'' Mr. Pechman said, ''that I approved of the base-broadening feature of the current tax-reform movement.'' Mr. Pechman used the huge file of tax data he had constructed at Brookings to show that the progressivity of the United States tax system - never very pronounced except during and immediately after the two world wars - has been declining for more than two decades and that the 1986 law had reversed this decline only slightly. The discussions of how to turn the socialist economies into market economies, or how to blend socialism and capitalism, involved a great deal of speculation, even anxiety, as to whether the degree of central planning and control that the socialist leaders still want can be efficiently combined with free markets. Need for Trust Stressed John M. Litwack of Stanford University stressed that a serious problem of the new socialist governments would be to achieve credibility, especially in their tax systems. People who feared the governments of the past and expected that policy changes would deprive them of their incomes would have little incentive to produce more and get out of the underground economy; it is therefore vital that trust in government be established. David Colander of Middlebury College said he and his associates, Kenneth Koford and Jeffrey Miller, would be trying to sell the Soviet Union a solution to the problem of how to combine price stability with high employment and strong economic growth that they had failed to sell in the United States. The solution, originally proposed by the late Prof. Abba P. Lerner in the 1960's, would be to create a ''market for prices,'' in which the total monetary demand for goods and services would be held to a non-inflationary level, while individual enterprises that wanted price increases could buy the rights to such increases from other enterprises willing to hold prices constant or reduce them. Incredibly Difficult Concept This would keep average prices stable, so that additions to money demand would be translated into real increases in production and real rises in jobs. But the concept seemed incredibly difficult to put into effect to those economists attending these meetings. Jan Dutta of Rutgers University, a specialist on the Chinese Communist economy, said he thought American economists were ''only looking at their thumbs, not yet doing serious thumb-sucking.'' Michael J. Boskin, chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, said the job of making socialism more effective was overwhelmingly the problem of the socialists themselves. On another issue, Mr. Boskin maintained that the peace dividend, when it emerged, should be used for reducing the budget deficit, not for new programs. He also re-emphasized President Bush's intention of not seeking to close the budget gap by raising taxes, but by trimming expenditures. Murray L. Weidenbaum, the first chairman of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, suggested that the peace dividend, although important, would not bulk large in the American economic future. ''The generally accepted belief among economists,'' he said, was that ''the American economy could attain prosperity with a defense establishment greatly reduced from the present level.'' 'Relatively Minor Player' ''The defense program,'' Mr. Weidenbaum added, ''is a relatively minor player in the American economy, accounting for one-fifteenth of the G.N.P. and an even smaller proportion of the nation's work force. Economic activity in the United States marches essentially to the beat of civilian drummers.'' He said, however, that as a consequence of the peace dividend a geographic shift in income and employment could be expected from the aerospace and electronics companies on the West Coast and New England to the more conventional industries of the Middle West. Mr. Weidenbaum added that a ''high or even rapidly rising level of defense spending does not necessarily mean that the nation is becoming more secure.''\n",
            "doc 40: Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, in a year-end plea to Congress and the White House for additional Federal judgeships, warned yesterday that ''the war on drugs will fail if the judiciary is not given the judgeships necessary to do the job.'' In his annual report on the Federal judiciary, the Chief Justice asked for ''immediate action'' on a recent proposal to create 59 new judgeships for the Federal District Courts, which now have 575 positions, and 16 for the Federal appellate courts, which now have 168. Fifty-seven of the existing judgeships are vacant. The request for more judges was made in October by the Judicial Conference of the United States, the top policy-making body for the Federal courts, of which the Chief Justice is chairman. Neither Congress nor the Bush Administration has acted on the recommendation. No new Federal judgeships have been created since 1984. Since that time, Chief Justice Rehnquist said in his report, the criminal caseload of the Federal District Courts has increased by 25 percent and the appellate courts' dockets have grown by more than 26 percent. Drugs Cases Nearly Tripled He said drug cases in the District Courts have nearly tripled since 1980. Nearly 55 percent of all criminal appeals now involve drug offenses, the report said, as against 30 percent in 1980. The Chief Justice's report reflected the concern and frustration that many Federal judges have expressed over the extent to which drug prosecutions now dominate Federal court dockets. While holding the number of judges constant, Congress over the past two years has authorized a 50 percent increase in the number of Federal prosecutors, with the 1,200 to 1,300 new prosecutors being assigned primarily to narcotics and white-collar crime. The Chief Justice said that the result is an ''hourglass-shaped law enforcement system.'' He said: ''Huge personnel assets have been added to bring about more prosecutions, and huge assets have been devoted to prisons to house the convicted, but without the judge-power to handle the added workload, there will be a bottleneck in the middle of the system, substantially lessening our ability to win the war on drugs.'' On other topics, Chief Justice Rehnquist commended Congress and President Bush for the judicial pay increases that were part of the Ethics Reform Act signed into law in November. The need for a pay increase was the focus of his annual report a year ago. 'A Debt of Thanks' ''The pay issue has been satisfactorily resolved, and the entire judiciary owes a debt of thanks to the President and those in Congress who spearheaded the effort for pay reform,'' the Chief Justice said. Under the legislation, judicial pay will increase by nearly 35 percent, in two steps, by Jan. 1, 1991. Salaries for Federal District Judges will go from $89,500 to $120,800 and for Court of Appeals judges from $95,000 to $128,100. The Chief Justice's own salary will rise from $115,000 to $155,000, or $7,000 more than the pay of the eight Associate Justices. Ousting 'Mandatory Appeals' Chief Justice Rehnquist also thanked Congress for a bill it passed 18 months ago, which became fully effective only this year, giving the Supreme Court nearly total discretion over selecting cases for review. The bill amended laws dating to the 1920's that had required the Court to hear certain categories of appeals. The categories had included appeals from Federal court decisions holding Federal statutes unconstitutional and appeals from state court decisions holding that state laws did not violate the Federal Constitution. These so-called ''mandatory appeals,'' the most nettlesome area of Supreme Court jurisdiction, had accounted for about 20 percent of the cases the Court decided every year, with the rest coming from categories over which the Court already had complete discretion. For years before the bill finally passed, the Justices had been unanimous in urging Congress to abolish the Court's mandatory jurisdiction. In the past year, the number of cases the Court has accepted for decision has dropped markedly, and abolition of the mandatory appeals had appeared to be at least partly responsible for the downward trend. The Chief Justice appeared to confirm this yesterday when he said that ''It is clear that this law is having a very beneficial impact on the Court's selection of cases.'' He said that ''abolition of mandatory appeals provides all of us with greater latitude to select only those cases that have general public importance.''\n",

Passing Ships, the odds-on choice, covered two and a quarter miles on the good track in 3:55 3/5 to earn $51,390 for Gold'N-Oats Stable with his fifth consecutive victory and his sixth in 13 starts in 1989. The horse was ridden by Angel Cordero Jr. and carried 117 pounds. High Policy, ridden by Jorge Chavez and assigned 109 pounds, was second in the six-horse field, 12 lengths ahead of Bally Blue, who carried 112 pounds, including Nick Santagata. Hierarchy, Ask Not and Gaita Potata completed the order of finish. Passing Ships paid $3.20, $2.60 and $2.10 for $2 across the board. High Policy paid $6 and $3 and Bally Blue paid $2.60 to show. (AP) TENNIS Victory for McEnroe and Shriver: John McEnroe teamed with Pam Shriver and kept his temper in check yesterday to guide the United States into the final of the Hopman Cup exhibition team tournament at the Burswood Superdome in Perth, Australia. The former top-ranked player in the world trounced Mark Woodforde, 6-3, 6-3, in the men's singles, then was partner to Shriver in a 6-3, 7-6 victory over Woodforde and Hana Mandlikova in the mixed doubles as the United States defeated Australia in the semifinals. Tonight, the top-seeded American team will face second-seeded Spain in the final of the 12-team competition. The Spanish brother-and-sister team of Emilio Sanchez and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario defeated Czechoslovakia, 2-1, in the other semifinal, which was played Saturday night. McEnroe, who was penalized a game after a series of outbursts in his quarterfinal singles victory over the Italian Paolo Cane, was again in a volatile mood, but never seemed to lose concentration. He gave a polished, disciplined performance in the singles against Woodforde, an Australian Davis Cup player, winning in just 68 minutes.(AP) HOCKEY Canada 3, Finland 3: Canada tied Finland, 3-3, yesterday in the world junior championships in Helsinki and must win its three remaining games to win the gold medal for the fourth time. Canada will play the Soviet Union today and Sweden on Wednesday and will finish the eight-nation, round-robin tournament against Czechoslovakia on Thursday. In yesterday's other game, Sweden routed Poland, 14-0. The Soviets and the Czechoslovaks are tied for first with four victories apiece. They meet tomorrow in what most observers feel will be the match for the gold medal. Canada is third while Sweden is one point behind with three victories and a loss. Finland follows in fifth. Eric Lindros had a chance to win the game for Canada with 30 seconds left in the game. Lindros and Steve Rice poured down on Henry Eskelinen on a two-on-one break. Lindros had a clear shot but slipped a pass to Rice and Finland's goalie was not fooled by the play.(AP)\n",
            "doc 42: THOSE on Donovan Ruddock's Christmas-card list got a personalized card this year. Ruddock, who is known in boxing circles as Razor, is the heavyweight contender who was to have fought Mike Tyson for the title on Nov. 18 in Edmonton, Alberta. But the fight was postponed when Tyson developed chest problems. To add insult to injury, Ruddock was put on hold when Tyson said he would keep a Feb. 11 commitment to fight Buster Douglas in Tokyo and then maybe box Evander Holyfield on June 18. Lest we forget his troubles with Tyson, this year's Christmas card from Ruddock had a photo of the contender in a tuxedo on the front, and this red-lettered notation: ''Merry Christmas From Donovan (Razor) Ruddock, the next heavyweight champion. . . . All I wanted for Christmas is . . .'' Open the card and there was, forgive the expression, Ruddock's punch line: ''Mike's two front teeth.'' The inside illustration? A pair of teeth, a white one and a companion gold tooth, presumably those of the heavyweight champion of the world.\n",
            "doc 43: A Titan 3 rocket carrying British and Japanese communications satellites roared into space tonight after nine postponements as the Martin Marietta Corporation entered the commercial launching business. The 155-foot-tall booster blasted away from its launching pad at 7:07 P.M., brilliantly lighting the night sky as it climbed toward orbit. ''Everything looks good,'' the mission commentator, Bob Gordon, reported as the rocket sped into space. Twenty minutes after liftoff, the mission director, Vic Whitehead, reported that the upper stages of the Titan 3 had achieved a successful orbit ranging from 117 to 437 miles high. About an hour after liftoff, the British satellite was released, officials said. The other satellite was to be released later. #10th Launching Attempt The Titan got away on its 10th attempt. Originally set for Dec. 7, the launching was delayed once by a technical problem and eight times by strong, high altitude winds. The wind was no problem tonight, and the countdown proceeded without a hitch to an on-time liftoff. Packed in the nose cone of the Titan 3, the most powerful American commercial rocket, were the 14,700-pound JCSAT-2 and the 3,230-pound Skynet 4 satellites. JCSAT-2 will provide telephone, television, facsimile and high-speed data services for the Japanese. It is owned by the Japanese Communications Satellite Company. Skynet 4 will be used by the British Ministry of Defense for communicating with land, sea and air forces. The Japanese company and British Government share the $125 million cost of the rocket and launching services provided by Martin Marietta. Commercial Market The Titan 3, built at Martin Marietta's Denver plant, joins the Delta rocket, made by the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, in the commercial market. The Delta rocket hoisted a communications satellite for British Satellite Broadcasting in August. The General Dynamics Corporation plans to join the others next year with its Atlas rocket. The three American companies are competing with the European Space Agency's Ariane rocket. Ariane, which had a big head start on the American companies, has signed contracts covering about half the estimated 15 to 20 launches planned annually in the next several years. That leaves the three American companies and budding Soviet and Chinese commercial programs to compete for the remaining contracts.\n",
            "doc 44: IN the past few years - and increasingly so now that the Iron Curtain is being torn apart - East European athletes have streamed from their homelands for the West. But when Aja Zanova left Czechoslovakia in 1950, she was the first athlete from an Eastern bloc country to defect to the West. Now, thanks to the extraordinary events of 1989, she can look forward to going ''home'' again. Zanova was the ladies' singles world champion in 1949 and 1950. She was also the Czechoslovak national figure-skating champion from 1945 to 1950, and finished fifth in the 1948 Winter Olympics. After retaining the world title in 1950 at the age of 17, Zanova spent six months in England training with a Swiss coach, Arnold Gerschwilier. She decided, with her coach's help, to seek political asylum. She spent 10 days under British police protection in a private house before asking for asylum. In that period, she received daily threatening phone calls from the Czechoslovak Embassy and one day the Ambassador himself turned up at the door. ''The Government wanted me to go to Moscow for the rest of my life to teach young skaters, without my parents,'' she said. ''I wanted to come to America.'' On the last of those 10 days, a bored Zanova went out to buy some magazines without the knowledge of her guards. As she returned, she said, a black car filled with Czechoslovak agents pulled up beside her. ''Two men jumped out and ran after me,'' Zanova said. ''They yelled: 'Drop everything. You're Czech. You're our property!' I couldn't open the gate. I was yelling like Mario Lanza. Two men, who were British police, ran out of the house with my coach. They said, 'This person is under British protection.' They grabbed me and pulled me inside.'' Within weeks, she was in the United States, but she paid a price. Her parents, she said, were put under house arrest but her mother made a daring escape, slipping out the back door while her husband distracted the guards. She said her mother was wounded when the aircraft she was escaping in was fired at by a Soviet fighter. Zanova said her father, Miroslav Vrzan, a high official with the Ministry of Finance, was sent to work in coal mines as a political prisoner. When he became ill in the 1970's Aja wanted to visit him. ''They wouldn't give me a visa,'' she said bitterly. ''They wanted $10,000 for one and I couldn't be sure that they would allow me to return.'' Born Aja Vrzanova in Prague, she simplified the spelling of her name when she came to the United States for easier pronunciation. She declined movie offers and turned pro with the Ice Follies in 1951. She skated with that troupe for three years and then joined the Ice Capades. She did a popular commercial with a ball point pen attached to her skate in the early 1960's. She retired from skating in 1967 and is now a talent scout for the Ice Capades. She also helped choreograph Debi Thomas's free-skating routine to music from ''Carmen,'' which Thomas used in the 1988 Winter Olympics. ''The Communist regime broke up my family,'' said Zanova. ''That's what I am most angry about. I hope to see my land again. I've been a citizen here since 1955. This is my country and I will fight for it. But I want to go back and see old Prague. ''Thank God it's changing. Maybe I can go next year.''\n",
            "doc 45: Prime Minister Hun Sen expressed concern today that Khmer Rouge forces were coordinating military operations and strategy with non-Communist guerrilla armies supported by the United States, and he said the Khmer Rouge had obtained weapons from the non-Communist factions. In an interview, the Prime Minister said Khmer Rouge guerrillas had received American-made antitank weapons from the non-Communist forces despite Washington's assertion that such arms transfers had not occurred. The Cambodian Government is fighting a three-party coalition made up of the Communist Khmer Rouge and two non-Communist guerrilla groups led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk and Son Sann, a former Prime Minister. Displays M-16 Rifles Mr. Hun Sen displayed M-16 rifles and grenade launchers that he said had been seized from Khmer Rouge guerrillas during fighting in October. He said that the guerrillas had obtained the weapons from Prince Sihanouk's army. There was no way to verify the source of the weapons independently, and Mr. Hun Sen did not say how many weapons the Khmer Rouge had obtained from the Sihanouk army. Cambodian officials and foreign diplomats said the war was confined mainly to three provinces along the Thai border and appeared to be at an impasse. The 38-year-old Prime Minister said that Cambodia would hold national elections by early 1991 regardless of whether his Government reaches a negotiated political settlement with the guerrilla forces. The Prime Minister said he hoped to achieve a political settlement of the civil war so the United Nations could send experts to Cambodia to ''organize the elections.'' Opposition candidates, including Prince Sihanouk, could then take part in the voting, he said. International Observers Invited In the absence of a political solution, Mr. Hun Sen said, Cambodia plans to organize elections by itself and invite international observers to monitor the vote. His comments were the most explicit statement by any Cambodian official of the Government's intention to hold elections monitored by international observers. Gen. Peng Path, a Vice Minister of Defense, said in an interview that the tactics of the Khmer Rouge were more clever and sophisticated than those of the non-Communist factions. The Khmer Rouge forces, led by Pol Pot, save their ammunition and quietly send infiltrators deep into Cambodia while allowing the non-Communist forces to assault Cambodian Government positions near the border, he said. If the guerrilla coalition starts to prevail, the Khmer Rouge would be the first to arrive in Phnom Penh and would be in a better position to seize power, he said. Thus, he concluded: ''The most dangerous enemy is Pol Pot. The Khmer Rouge is more patient, more persistent, and can endure more'' than the non-Communist factions. Mr. Hun Sen said, ''U.S. arms that were provided to the other side could not fail to fall into the hands of the Khmer Rouge.'' Artillery Support Cited Khieu Kanharith, editor of the weekly newspaper Kampuchea, said the Khmer Rouge had provided artillery support to the guerrillas. Gen. Peng Path said that Phnom Penh had received most of its weapons from Moscow and that there had been no change in the level of arms shipments in the last six months. Mr. Hun Sen said the date for elections would be set by the National Assembly. Several Cambodian officials said they were considering dates in the first half of 1990. ''If there is a political solution, we would organize elections within the framework of that solution,'' Mr. Hun Sen said. ''If there is no political solution, we would have to organize elections on a unilateral basis. One way or the other, elections will be held.'' The United States and most Western countries have refused to recognize the current Phnom Penh Government, saying it is illegitimate because it was installed by Vietnamese invaders in January 1979. The Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia from 1975 to January 1979. It presided over a brutal restructuring of society in which more than a million Cambodians were killed.\n",
            "doc 46: At a time when bankers and economists speak of a global financial village, with the world's centers of finance closely linked and interdependent, the Tokyo stock market is increasingly going its own stable and buoyant way. With Japan's wealth growing dramatically in recent years, the Japanese stock market is now watched as a leader, often admired and envied in New York and London. By providing a steady pool of low-cost capital, the Tokyo market supplies ample funds to Japanese corporations for spending on research and development, building new factories and training employees - all of which strengthen the Japanese economy. The aspect of the Japanese market's performance gaining the most attention is its relative stability. Today Tokyo, not New York, is more and more being looked on as a possible model of how a stock market should be run, a dramatic conceptual shift that underscores the importance that financial experts are starting to place on stability for fostering economic health. A Lesson for the West ''The interesting thing is how the Japanese manage to incorporate a huge amount of change and yet remain stable,'' said Robert Alan Feldman, economist here for Salomon Brothers. ''That is something for the West to consider.'' Perhaps the most telling statement one can make about the powerful Japanese stock market is noting what did not happen here in the last few years: the Tokyo Stock Exchange did not crash along with Wall Street in October 1987 and barely budged last October, when the markets in New York again went into a tailspin. Indeed, after declining less than 2 percent to New York's 7 percent on Oct. 13, the market here glided gently upward to close 1989 at a record 38,915.87, up 31 percent for the year and largely free of the volatile jolts that afflicted New York. ''There was a time when people here always took New York as the barometer, when it seemed as if Tokyo reacted so strongly to whatever happened there,'' said Lawrence S. Prager, a senior analyst and stock strategist for Nikko Securities. ''I don't know when exactly, but that has definitely changed and Tokyo has taken off more on its own.'' 'Shot Off Like a Rocket' ''Ten or 15 years ago, if there was anxiety elsewhere Tokyo just sucked it up,'' added Roy Smith, former head of Goldman, Sachs's international operations and now a business professor at New York University. ''But the Japanese are not dependent on foreigners now. Tokyo just sort of shot off like a rocket in the latter half of the 80's on its own.'' The tremendous wealth built up in Japan in the last several years accounts for much of this shift in the balance of financial power. The Government estimated that at the end of last year Japan had ''national assets'' worth $43.75 trillion, compared with $19.4 trillion at the end of 1985. ''International power is now in Tokyo,'' said Kazuo Otaka, deputy general manager of Daiwa Securities' investment advisory department. Japanese have been using some of this growing cash hoard to buy up huge amounts of American stocks and bonds, while foreigners, and Americans especially, have been slowly selling off their Japanese securities. In the first eight months of 1989, for instance, Japanese made net purchases of foreign shares, mostly American, of $15 billion. At the same time, foreign investors made $14.5 billion of net sales of Japanese stocks. That trend has only underscored the lessening influence of foreign capital on the market here. In the early 1980's, roughly 20 percent of the turnover in Tokyo was attributed to foreigners, while today the figure is less than 10 percent. Influence Growing Steadily At the same time, Tokyo's financial influence in the United States and elsewhere has grown relentlessly. Mere rumors about how much of the American Government's Treasury bond auctions the Japanese will buy can send the bond market sharply up or down. The new wealth here has also meant that turnover on the Tokyo Stock Exchange is significantly higher than in New York now and that the total value of Tokyo stocks has, since 1988, exceeded the total value of shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange. This boom has reflected a remarkable surge in the Japanese economy over the last five years, which some are starting to call the second economic miracle because of how successfully Japanese industry has transformed itself into a more efficient and more technology-oriented engine of growth. The steady climb of the Japanese market has been particularly noteworthy because, starting in late 1985, the United States and Japan have seen a doubling in the yen's value, a shock that sharply reduced the competitiveness of Japan's export industries. Nonetheless, under the watchful eye of powerful Government bureaucrats, the economy and the stock market shrugged off those problems and changed as needed to adapt to the new conditions. Philosophical Watershed Japan's performance has prompted a re-examination in the West of the merits of more stable and more controlled financial markets, with Tokyo as the model example. The philosophical watershed on Wall Street came with the stock market crash in 1987. Although a free market approach had been gaining ground elsewhere in the economy, for the first time Wall Street began to think seriously about creating restraints in the market, oriented toward trying to dampen volatility; in other words, it is trying to make New York more like Tokyo, where a range of formal and informal mechanisms limited price swings after October 1987 and helped them rebound smoothly shortly afterward. The New York Stock Exchange suddenly began to call for ''circuit breakers,'' ways to halt the market and give a brief cooling-off period when it rose or fell sharply; Tokyo has had them for years. The Big Board began to consider various ways to stop program trading, a computer-driven strategy that some regard as a source of volatility; Japanese Government authorities were late in introducing stock index futures, necessary to many forms of program trading, and have made it difficult to do program trading on a large scale. The philosophical shift was completed earlier this month when the New York Stock Exchange took out a full-page ad in newspapers to declare a campaign to try to obtain the kind of stability that Tokyo has taken for granted. 'A Serious Threat' ''Excess volatility is a serious threat to our nation's capital markets and the American economy,'' said John J. Phelan Jr., the exchange's chairman. That this volatility does more than hurt or help speculators has become increasingly evident in the contrast between New York and Tokyo in their abilities to raise capital for corporations - in theory, the fundamental purpose of the market. After trailing New York for years, the Tokyo Stock Exchange surpassed New York at the time of the 1987 crash. For the first eight months of this year Japanese companies raised $110 billion in new capital, more than five times the amount American companies raised in New York from stock offerings during the same time. There are, of course, many features of the Tokyo stock market that the United States could not emulate and probably would not like to. Japan's big four securities houses exercise immense power here, companies pay minuscule dividends and smaller shareholders have fewer means of exercising their rights as corporate owners. Strength of the Groups In addition, most major companies and financial institutions are organized into groups, known as keiretsu, in which all the members maintain large shareholdings in one another. These relationships tend to bolster the group and block out outsiders. They also make hostile takeovers all but impossible. On top of that, any independence being exercised by the Tokyo stock market is relative. In fact, capital is flowing more and more freely across national borders, forcing each country to adjust to major economic shifts elsewhere. Tokyo is in a process of deregulation now, which in some ways is tending to bring it into line with United States financial markets. But the extraordinarily slow pace of the changes and the care with which they are being worked out with the affected companies tend to insure few disruptions and the maintenance of stability. The end result is that a market that entered the 1980's subsidiary to New York's overwhelming influence is now, at the least, standing on its own, sticking to its own ways and exercising more influence over the rest of the financial system.\n",
            "doc 47: A Federal district judge in Arizona granted a Government motion on Friday to dismiss three counts in a lawsuit related to the Government's seizure of the insolvent Lincoln Savings and Loan Association in California. The suit was filed by Lincoln's parent corporation, the American Continental Corporation, against a number of Government entities and officials and seeks $200 million in damages. American Continental contends that officials of the Office of Thrift Supervision and other agencies disclosed information to the public that harmed Lincoln financially. Judge Richard Bilby of the United States District Court in Phoenix dismissed several counts of the suit that named the Office of Thrift Supervision as a defendant. The judge agreed with the Government's argument that any court order blocking a Federal agency from disclosing information is unenforceable when the information is disclosed by individual agency employees. Mike Gallagher, a lawyer for American Continental, said other defendants remain in the suit, including M. Danny Wall, former head of the Office of Thrift Supervision, and William Black, former vice president of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in San Francisco. Tom Mason, a spokesman for the Office of Thrift Supervision, said no one was available to comment. Federal regulators took control of Lincoln on April 14. The cost of the takeover is expected to be the highest ever, exceeding $2 billion.\n",
            "doc 48: President Corazon C. Aquino announced changes in her Cabinet today in the aftermath of the military mutiny against her Government earlier this month. Mrs. Aquino appointed new ministers for the Departments of Justice, Agriculture, Transportation, Finance, Education and Agrarian Reform. She also named a new adviser on the military and a new press secretary. ''The thrust of these changes is the need always to adjust to new situations, to assure not only continued, but more importantly, improved delivery of government services,'' Mrs. Aquino said in a televised statement. Criticized as Insufficient But the Cabinet changes were more a shuffle than a purge, and although the overhaul involved more officials than previous Cabinet shuffles, critics said the changes were not sweeping enough. In the months before the rebellion, public discontent with the Government rose because of its frustrating inability to provide adequate services, especially transportation and power. The mutineers, who staged a six-day revolt that nearly toppled Mrs. Aquino, took advantage of the Government's growing unpopularity. By appointing a new Secretary of Transportation, Mrs. Aquino hopes to improve that public service, especially in the capital, where thousands line the streets for hours each day to wait for a ride home. A new Education Secretary was named to deal with the restiveness of teachers, who have conducted a series of strikes demanding better pay. Defense Chief Stays But President Aquino retained Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos, who is thought by many in the military to be politically ambitious and unable to unite contending army factions. Mr. Ramos, a retired general who was previously Mrs. Aquino's Chief of Staff, has remained loyal to the Government and defended it against five takeover attempts in the last three years. Mrs. Aquino also retained the Trade and Industry Secretary, Jose Concepcion Jr., whose family owns an industrial conglomerate. Critics say that Mr. Concepcion has a conflict of interest and that his family's companies have flourished during his Cabinet tenure.\n",
            "doc 49: At the stroke of midnight, Poland becomes the first Eastern European country to leap into the capitalist era. But whether Poland makes a successful leap or falls flat on its face depends in large part on whether the Government's economic overhaul, which takes effect on Monday, can maintain the support of industrial towns like this tractor-producing center. For Zbigniew Hertel, a 42-year-old foundry worker at the Ursus Tractor Works, the crash economic program is something to boast about because, if successful, it will make Poland the first Communist nation to embrace capitalism. Harsh Economic Medicine But Mr. Hertel says he frets that the effort to turn Poland into a dynamic market-oriented economy will exact a lot of pain at first: a spurt in inflation, a wave of layoffs and a 20 percent drop in income for many workers. Still, if this short strong-jawed man is any guide, the 17,000 workers at the Ursus plant are ready to swallow some harsh economic medicine in the hope that it will revive the prostrate economy left by 45 years of Communist rule. ''We have been in an economic morass for years,'' said Mr. Hertel, sitting in an orange armchair facing a modestly trimmed Christmas tree that scraped against his living-room ceiling. Jolting the Economy Forward ''We recognize that we're going to have to tighten our belts for a while if we're to turn things around.'' The Government's big worry is that Ursus tractor workers, Silesian coal miners or Nowa Huta steelworkers will grow tired of the strong medicine and go on strike if it takes too long to show results. After all, Polish workers have a long history of striking against price increases imposed by the Communists. Labor unrest this time could prompt the Government to water down its economic plan, even though it maintains the overhaul must remain potent to jolt the economy forward. The plan, pushed through Parliament by the Solidarity-led Government that took power after elections last summer, calls for injecting heavy doses of market forces into Poland's ossified Communist economy in the hope of making it grow faster. That means scrapping most price controls, slashing subsidies for goods and services, permitting companies to lay off unneeded workers and allowing inefficient enterprises to go bankrupt. The plan also calls for making the Polish zloty the first convertible currency in Eastern Europe. Polish news organizations reported today that the National Bank would devalue the zloty for the 12th time since September to reduce the gap between the official exchange rate and a newly legal unofficial rate available to all citizens. Quadrupling Electric Bills For Mr. Hertel, his wife, Jozefina, and their two daughters, the crash economic plan means they will have to pay four times as much for electricity for their crowded four-room apartment in an unremarkable gray block built for tractor factory workers. In addition, the price of a bus ride to central Warsaw, seven miles to the east, will more than double. The plan has also prompted people to strip Ursus's store shelves of chicken, kielbasa, beer and many other items as they rushed to buy whatever they could in expectation of a leap in prices when stores reopen on Tuesday. The Government predicts the prices will soar by 50 percent in January alone. As for Mr. Hertel's job, the economic plan is expected to result in thousands of layoffs at the fortress-like red-brick tractor plant, a chilly one-mile walk from his apartment. ''A British consultant came here and said we have to reduce the work force by a few thousand,'' Mr. Hertel said. ''There will have to be layoffs to make it economically sound. 'They Can Easily Lay Off 2' ''We know that all over the factory where there are five guys working, they can easily lay off two,'' he continued. ''The three who remain could then earn more money, and the other two could go work elsewhere, in the post office, for instance, where the lines are always so long to mail something.'' Mr. Hertel said he worries far more about the rise in prices than about the possibility of unemployment. He has worked for 20 years at the tractor plant, where he has a dangerous job forging axles and gearboxes. ''People who do good work, they shouldn't have to worry,'' he said. ''But a lot of the people who sit around all day in white-collar jobs doing I don't know what, they're another story.'' Mr. Hertel complained that many things his family wants to buy are already far beyond its reach, and he says that the crash economic plan will squeeze his family a little more. For years, he has yearned to buy a Polonez, a modest compact car, which costs 27 million zlotys, or about $3,000, A Monthly Family Income of $95 ''The only way we could afford it is if we did not eat or buy anything for several years,'' he said. Mr. Hertel and his wife, a scientific technician, earn a total of $95 a month at the official exchange rate. They worry that the cost of basics like clothes and shoes will skyrocket. A well-made pair of leather boots that cost 3,500 zlotys two years ago has already risen to 230,000 zlotys, or about $25. ''We spend all the money we have without being able to save anything,'' said Mrs. Hertel, a petite woman with long brown hair. Her husband added: ''We're lucky. We've lived long enough to be able to furnish our house. But young people with children, I don't envy them. How are they going to buy things to furnish their house?'' 'Willing to Sacrifice' Minutes before today's 11 A.M. mass began at the town's church, St. Joseph the Worker, Witold Karczmarczyk, a 34-year-old worker at the Ursus plant, was standing out front with his 3-year-old daughter and 6-year-old son. As he shivered in front of the gray stone building, he did not sound alarmed by the crash economic plan. Mr. Karczmarczyk has had it tough for years, he said, and he expects to continue to have it tough. At least the plan offers a chance for life in Poland to improve. ''I couldn't buy a lot of things before, but we had enough for food,'' he said. ''I don't expect to be eating any worse after Jan. 1, but perhaps there will be some additional things we won't be able to afford.'' ''Look,'' he continued, ''I'm willing, the people in the plant are willing, to sacrifice. We all hope things will get better.'' 'God Gives, God Grants' Inside the church's oak-paneled sacristy, the Rev. Jerzy Rozalski, a husky strong-voiced man, said that as a new decade begins hope outweighs fear in Ursus. ''People are optimistic,'' he said. ''But they are certainly worried about prices. No one knows the details of what is going to happen, but the feeling is God gives, God grants, and we'll somehow get through it.'' Early in the 1980's St. Joseph's was a bastion of Solidarity activity, with a courageous priest, the Rev. Jozef Nowak, holding pro-Solidarity masses and helping organize hunger strikes. Solidarity - and the Solidarity-led Government - still have a strong grip on the workers here, including Mr. Hertel. 'We Have to Trust Them' Out of loyalty to the Government, Mr. Hertel said, he even backs the most sensitive part of the economic plan: wage controls. These aim to keep wages below the inflation rate to prevent an upward wage-price spiral. The Government hopes that after inflation jumps in early January, it will level off to a few percent a month by summer. ''We elected these people, they chose experts to develop these policies, and we have to trust them,'' Mr. Hertel said. ''It would be wrong to go on strike against a plan put together by a Government that we elected.'' Mr. Hertel said he expects Poland to go through a harrowing few months of inflation, layoffs and austerity. But he said he believes that in a year or two, things will start to get better. ''My hope,'' he said, ''is that in 5 or 10 years I will be able to tell my children with some confidence that their lives will be a good deal better than ours.''\n",
            "doc 50: Fanyana Zwane was watching television with two of his sons one evening last August when two Soviet-made hand grenades smashed a window and exploded in their living room, seriously wounding 12-year-old Gabriel. The neighborhood in the black township of Soweto, where the Zwanes live, was shocked but not surprised. ''He's a very nice chap generally, but he's a senior police officer,'' a neighbor said of Lieutenant Colonel Zwane, who is the ranking black officer in the South African police. ''And policemen are targets of the A.N.C. because they represent the system.'' Guerrillas of the African National Congress, or the A.N.C., were believed responsible for the attack on the Zwane family. But black policemen also get killed or wounded by gangsters, shunned as quislings by some other blacks and, according to Lieut. Gregory Rockman, a police officer of mixed race, patronized by their white colleagues. Yet blacks volunteer for the South African police in overwhelming numbers. ''There's a lot of intimidation on the outside and they still keep on coming,'' said Col. Mike Bester, the white commandant of the training college for black police cadets at Hammanskraal. Separate Uniforms Eliminated More than half of South Africa's 65,000 policemen and policewomen are nonwhite and their numbers are increasing, though white Afrikaners still command the national police force. Separate uniforms for blacks and whites were eliminated six years ago and pay and rank structure have been made the same for all races. The South African police force still runs four separate police colleges for whites, blacks, Indians and those of mixed race. A white instructor at Hammanskraal said black recruits needed more weapons training than whites, most of whom grew up around firearms. A police officer's modest salary and benefits, which start at 911 rand a month, equivalent to $355, has led whites to continue leaving for higher-paying jobs elsewhere. But the pay is good by black standards and job security attractive. Many volunteers come from rural areas where unemployment is rampant and political protest minimal. ''The police force pays better than nursing and the promotions some faster,'' said Diana M. Masilela, a police cadet from Atteridgeville who was formerly a nurse. Cadet Masilela said the job security was important. ''If you become injured and disabled for the rest of your life, the police will give a suitable job for you,'' she said. 'It's Not Just the Money' But, said Colonel Zwane, ''it's not just the money.'' ''If you don't like the work, you won't last.'' He and several other black policemen said they joined to help combat the crime afflicting impoverished black townships. A survey issued last May by the Human Sciences Research Council reported that 42 percent of the blacks it had interviewed considered crime a serious problem, compared with 8 percent of whites. ''They are very much afraid of crime,'' said Franz Nikelo, a police cadet at Hammanskraal. ''I mean everyone is.'' He said he quit teaching mathemetics and science in Botshabello, a black township in the Orange Free State, because of what he described as politically motivated chaos in the classroom. ''I realized there are many elements that are not suitable to be in society,'' Cadet Nikelo said. ''So I thought in order to help society, I should become a policeman.'' Behind Barbed Wire A Soweto journalist said black policemen were well regarded in the townships until 1976, when the Government used them to help suppress a Soweto uprising. In a subsequent wave of unrest between 1984 and 1986, the police became targets of black protesters, and hundreds were assaulted or had homes burned down. They are still shot at and sometimes their families have been intimidated by militant youths. As a result, some police officers live behind barbed wire next to the police stations. ''Sometimes it doesn't stop there,'' said Warrant Officer Benjamin Mavuso. ''Your daughter will be teaching and they will tell her not to come to school.'' The warrant officer, a 15-year veteran, said it was shortsighted of blacks to view policemen as enemies. ''They say we are dogs of the Government,'' he said. ''We say no, we are not dogs, we are trying to help people, because if there are no policemen, nothing will go right. Racism Is Charged Lieutenant Rockman caused a stir last September when he accused white riot policemen of brutality in his mixed-race township of Mitchell's Plain. He complained that the whites refused to obey his orders, and has charged that the South African police is riddled with racism. ''We're not there to uphold the Government,'' Lieutenant Rockman told the Cape Town Press Club recently. ''That's not our job.'' A white police officer said Lieutenant Rockman was recently suspended from duty not for criticizing the police but for defying orders to stop talking to the press. ''The tremendous discrimination he spoke about I don't think exists,'' the officer said. The black policemen interviewed said they were protecting people rather than the system. Cadet Nikelo called crime a worse threat to blacks than apartheid. ''When the rate of crime has been lessened, we can then look at apartheid,'' he said. Colonel Zwane, whose brother, brother-in-law and cousin are also policemen, said: ''It's stupid to think that black policemen are collaborators. I don't think we can be a police force if only whites are policemen. We need blacks to investigate. We understand our own people better so it's important that we be there.''\n",
            "doc 51: In the world of commodity futures trading, Leo Melamed is widely considered to be the chief lobbyist, spokesman and public relations man - and an adept one at that. In 1990, Mr. Melamed, the chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's executive committee, will need all those qualities and others to restore his industry's tarnished image. The problem is the continuing investigation into trading abuse on the floor of the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade. In addition to producing about 47 indictments and about half as many guilty pleas, the investigation has prompted lawmakers to consider tighter regulation of the futures business. That is something Mr. Melamed dreads, having championed the idea of ''self-regulation'' in futures and been a founding chairman of the National Futures Association, a self-regulatory group. This is not the first time Mr. Melamed has had to beat back attempts at tighter control. In 1987 the Merc was accused of contributing to the market crash but Mr. Melamed appeared before Congressional committees to give Chicago's version. It was his testimony, experts said, that partly led Congress not to impose a tighter lease on the industry. Around the time the indictments were made public, the Federal Government issued a report charging that both Chicago exchanges' systems for policing trading activity were lacking. It has thus fallen heavily on Mr. Melamed - a diminutive, black-haired man - to ease the concerns of those who have begun to question whether the futures markets can be trusted. He must do this while pursuing another important project, Globex, the Merc's computerized trading system that is already several months behind schedule. If his history is any guide, however, Mr. Melamed is almost certain not to shun a battle with critics. His background is filled with stories of personal struggle and extraordinary efforts to succeed. Born in Poland, Mr. Melamed moved with his parents to Chicago shortly before Pearl Harbor. Years later, to support his wife and child and pay his way through law school, he drove a cab. He borrowed $3,100 from his father to begin trading egg futures at what was then the Merc's predecessor. Striking it rich later in pork-belly futures, he organized the young Merc members who created committees to develop new contracts. Mr. Melamed's contribution to that effort: The creation of futures contracts based on foreign currencies and on the interest rate being paid on Eurodollars. That success, and others, has already earned Mr. Melamed a reputation as one of the driving forces behind financial futures.\n",
            "doc 52: Turner Broadcasting System Inc. is suing the Bush Administration to be allowed to provide its Cable News Network to Vietnam. The company wants to provide a satellite receiving station to Vietnam at no charge and sell it the right to take the CNN signal for 50 Vietnamese dong a year, or less than a penny, said Bertram Carp, a Turner vice president. American law prohibits most trade with Vietnam. Turner said in its lawsuit in Federal District Court in Washington that CNN would qualify under a 1988 measure that exempts information materials. Mr. Carp said last week that the suit asked the court to order the Treasury Department's office of foreign assets control to allow CNN to provide the receiving station and signal.\n",
            "doc 53: When Westley Allan Dodd was arrested in November and charged with killing three young boys in this Columbia River community, his case provided critics of the legal system with a tragic demonstration of their argument that the law has failed to protect society from sex offenders. In their view, the case provides ammunition for a conclusion that more health care professionals are reaching: that some habitual child molesters are basically incurable and should be locked up for life. Mr. Dodd has a history of sexually assaulting children and then undergoing court-ordered treatment. Focus Shifts to Treating Young ''It's only in the last few years that people have started to say that certain sex offenders are incurable,'' said Dr. Janis F. Bremer, a therapist at the Hennepin County Home School in Minnetonka, Minn., who is a member of a recent national group set up to study treatment methods for sexual offenders. She said the best hope lies with treatment of offenders when they are young, with the aim of stopping sexually deviant behavior before it becomes ingrained. Gail Ryan, of the University of Colorado's National Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Child Abuse and Neglect, said, ''I don't think we're prepared to say that anybody is incurable, but they may not be treatable with the current methods we have at our disposal.'' Two basic forms of treatment are used in most states. One involves intensive therapy and group sessions in which offenders learn to monitor the emotions that make them vulnerable to the sexual fantasies that lead to a crime, and to guard themselves against acting on them. The other approach tries to change behavior by shock therapy, drugs, hormone injections or, in extreme cases, chemical castration. There is little solid evidence on success rates for either form of treatment. The increasing pessimism about the prospects for therapy comes at a time, oddly enough, when the courts are responding to a surge in prosecutions of sex offenders by turning to mental health professionals for guidance. This has produced an explosion in the number of therapists treating rapists and child molesters and a widespread perception that many of them are unskilled and that the legal system's reliance on their judgment is misplaced. 'Anybody Can Hang a Shingle' In the last decade the number of specialists treating violent sex offenders has gone from 20 to more than 1,100, said Steven H. Jensen, head of the Association for the Behavioral Treatment of Sex Abusers, an organization of about 150 therapists based in Portland, Ore. But in Mr. Jensen's opinion, no more than 20 percent of these specialists are qualified to offer such treatment. ''Everyone from seasoned experts to outright charlatans are in the business,'' Mr. Jensen said. ''There is no training institution for treating sex offenders. Anybody can hang a shingle and call themselves a therapist.'' Because most therapists are not required by state laws to have any sort of academic degree or accreditation, Mr. Jensen is pressing for national standards so that sex therapists are regulated like medical doctors. Treatment by Former Felon To some experts and officials, Mr. Dodd represents a textbook study of what is wrong with attempts to cure offenders. Various experts had labeled him ''a dangerous sexual predator'' who should not be loose in society. But he was free at the time of his arrest for the three murders earlier this year. He had been released after he underwent eight months of court-ordered treatment in 1988 by a man who is himself a convicted felon. The therapist, Kenneth L. Von Cleve, of Bellevue, Wash., spent 13 years in prison for armed robbery and heroin smuggling before opening a counseling business in 1982 that specializes in treating criminals sent to him by the court. Dr. Von Cleve studied psychology while in Federal prison and obtained a Ph.D. from the University of Washington in that field shortly after he was paroled in 1979. He said his criminal background made him uniquely qualified to treat and understand offenders like Mr. Dodd. Mr. Dodd's treatment followed his conviction in Seattle on charges of trying to detain a 6-year-old boy. And the crime was the latest in an extensive history of crimes against children; at least twice before he was ordered by courts to attend sexual counseling as a condition of sentences. Mr. Dodd was given a one-year suspended jail term on the Seattle conviction on the condition that he complete a program for sex offenders. The program consisted of about one session a week for eight months. Dr. Von Cleve, who runs one of the largest sexual counseling businesses in the Seattle area, was recommended to the court by Mr. Dodd's lawyers. Prosecutors in King County, the Seattle jurisdiction where Mr. Dodd was convicted, said they were outraged that Mr. Dodd was sent to Dr. Von Cleve. ''The prosecutors don't like me,'' Dr. Von Cleve said, ''because they think I'm an advocate for sex offenders. I'm a therapist. I refuse to be a punisher. You cannot punish and treat someone at the same time.'' Robert Lasnik, a deputy prosecutor in King County who has just been named a Superior Court judge, said felons are not qualified to treat other felons. ''There are certain things a person can do after being rehabilitated from prison, but treating sex offenders should not be one of them,'' he said in an interview. Mr. Lasnik also objected to the growth of a virtual industry of therapists who he says specialize in persuading judges to sentence offenders to counseling instead of jail. History of Assaults on Minors About one year after Mr. Dodd ended his counseling with Dr. Von Cleve, he was arrested in Clark County, on the Oregon border, and charged with killing William Neer, 10; his brother Cole Neer, 11, and Lee Joseph Iseli, 4. Court documents indicate Mr. Dodd confessed to killing the Iseli boy. At least two of the boys had been molested before they were killed, according to court documents on file here. Prosecutors may seek the death penalty for Mr. Dodd, who is 28 years old. He has pleaded not guilty to three counts of first-degree murder. In the eyes of the court, Mr. Dodd completed the legal end of his treatment in 1988. But in Dr. Von Cleve's opinion, he needed at least three or four more years of counseling. ''Mr. Dodd's history of deviant assaults on minors is the most extensive I have ever encountered in an offender his age,'' Dr. Von Cleve wrote in a summary for the King County Superior Court. ''He is viewed as an extremely high risk for future reoffense.'' But Dr. Von Cleve said he never asked the court to order Mr. Dodd to undergo further therapy after his eight months of counseling. Nationwide, the debate over sex offenders has turned to the question of whether a therapeutic cure exists for violent molesters of children. Two Methods of Treatment While there is wide agreement that sex offenders are very difficult to treat, many experts believe therapy can be effective for offenders who are highly motivated to change. But that is not always easy to determine. In Mr. Dodd's case, Dr. Von Cleve told the court, ''At the present time, Mr. Dodd appears to be highly motivated for treatment.'' While some therapists advocate intensive counseling and others look to change behavior through drugs or stronger intervention, other experts say long prison sentences are the only sure safeguard for a community. The change in thinking is especially dramatic in Washington State, once thought to be a national model for its treatment programs of rapists and molesters. State officials are now considering an overhaul of sexual-offender laws after a series of crimes this year by people who had undergone years of state-sponsored counseling and therapy. A state panel set up by Gov. Booth Gardner has called for life sentences for crimes like violent rape and molestation of a child, and requirements that all convicted sexual offenders register with the county in which they reside after leaving prison. The group also proposes a new law that would allow state officials to commit certain sex offenders to an indefinite stay at a mental institution even after the prison time has been served. ''The research demonstrates that most child sex offenders will continue their abuses for many years and rarely are cured,'' the Governor's group concluded. Some of the suggestions have raised civil rights questions, like whether it is legal to put someone in an institution because he might commit a crime in the future. But several states, including Massachusetts, already have such civil commitment laws. Trying to Develop a Consensus ''What we've tried to do is isolate those people where there's a consensus that they are too dangerous to be back in society,'' said Norm Maleng, chairman of the group. ''As it is now, we have no way to protect the community from them.'' The panel, which includes several mental health professionals, was established after publicity about Earl K. Shriner, a convicted sex felon who was charged with molesting a 7-year-old Tacoma boy last May and then cutting him with a knife. Mr. Shriner, who had undergone years of counseling for earlier sex offenses, had been determined by the state to be a person likely to commit more sex crimes against children. Helen Harlow, mother of the Tacoma boy who was assaulted, has become a strong advocate for victims of sexual abuse. ''Much to my surprise, I've learned that there is quite a range for what constitutes treatment,'' Mrs. Harlow said. ''They cycle through these programs offenders to be back in the community in no time.''\n",
            "doc 54: As older Americans strive for healthier, more active lives, New York City is offering to help, by sharing its innovative fitness regimen tailored for men and women over age 60. Called ''Stay Well,'' the program was developed by the city's Department for the Aging and includes exercises, advice on stress management, invigorating walking tours and health education - all led by trained volunteers who must be at least 60 themselves. Stay Well now reaches 3,500 New Yorkers weekly, mainly at 80 centers for the elderly throughout the city. Beginning in March, private donors have agreed to finance its introduction at five sites still to be selected in New York State outside the city. Several states also are studying Stay Well, as is the Federal Government. ''We're following New York City's initiative closely because it challenges the stereotype that there is no need to focus on health promotion once people are old,'' said Dr. Joyce T. Berry, acting United States Commissioner on Aging. ''We know much can be done to avoid some diseases with good health habits, exercise, diet control and proper use of medication.'' 'You Are All Gorgeous' The concept of using elderly people to teach their contemporaries was particularly appealing, Dr. Berry said. ''Older people represent a valuable resource which we can tap more than we are doing,'' she said. At a Stay Well exercise class last week in Astoria, Queens, Anna Modifica, a 79-year-old great-grandmother, fired instructions, and 21 students obligingly flexed their feet, swung their arms, wiggled and stretched. ''You are all gorgeous,'' Mrs. Modifica said as she demanded more flexing and wiggling. ''She's not Jane Fonda, but she's a terrific model for other seniors,'' said Fran Friedman, director of Health Promotion Services at the city's Department for the Aging. ''It's less intimidating to be taught by one of your peers. You say to yourself, 'If she can do it, I can do it.' '' Stay Well was originated by Janet S. Sainer, the departing Commissioner of the Department for the Aging. She secured financial support for an experimental three-year program from the Florence V. Burden Foundation, the New York Community Trust, the Exxon Corporation, Metropolitan Life and the Uris Brothers Foundations and Morgan Guarantee Trust Company. Concern About Hypertension Impressed by older New Yorkers' response, the city agreed in 1986 to take over the program when the private sponsors ended their participation as planned. The program is a $200,000-a-year operation, a small item in the department's $88 million budget. Dr. Prema Mathai-Davis, the department's newly named Commissioner, said centers for the elderly offered an opportunity to reach large numbers of the estimated 1.3 million New Yorkers over age 60. Mrs. Sainer, who is 71 and became Commissioner in 1978, said Stay Well evolved from her concern about hypertension among older people. In 1980, she invited doctors from New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center to screen and monitor the blood pressure of participants at a center for the elderly at St. Malachy's Church on West 59th Street in Manhattan. Today, blood-pressure testing and recording participants' progress is a regular feature of Stay Well. Instructors learn the technique during their orientation courses, which are given at least twice a year. ''We also wanted to get the seniors out of their chairs,'' Mrs. Sainer said, ''so we developed the exercise classes with technical help from the New York Academy of Medicine.'' #400 Volunteer Instructors Costs of Stay Well are kept low by using volunteers like Mrs. Modifica, who instructs two or three classes a week at the Hellenic American Neighborhood Action Committee center in Astoria, and Agnes Brown, who leads a class at the East Flatbush Senior Center in Brooklyn in association with the Young Men's and Young Women's Hebrew Associations. The two women are among 400 instructors. The only material rewards they receive are yellow T-shirts with the Stay Well rainbow logo that they get after completing 12 weeks of instruction and an intensive six-week follow-up course. Mrs. Brown, a 67-year-old grandmother, ties her T-shirt smartly over her slim torso and begins her sessions with an inspirational poem. She ends it by insisting that her students open their eyes wide, growl and lunge like lions. ''I want you to go into lunch smiling as if you haven't a care in the world,'' she says. Stay Well is not the only health-promotion program designed for the elderly, but it is in the forefront, said Dr. Stephanie J. FallCreek, director of New Mexico's State Agency on the Aging. Dr. FallCreek said one of Stay Well's advantages was its adaptability for use at centers in lower-income neighborhoods. ''Many programs succeed with middle-class Anglo populations, which are easier to reach and generally have a higher health level than we find among the poor or minority groups - the groups that stand to benefit most,'' she said. Technical Advice As a first step toward extending Stay Well, the Department for the Aging compiled a handbook on the program; 5,000 copies of the $10 manual have been distributed. Copies are available from Stay Well, the Department for the Aging, New York, N.Y. 10007. To introduce Stay Well outside the city, all-day workshops will be held for health officials and community-center representatives. The department plans to continue providing technical advice and assistance to communities interested in developing programs. These costs will be met by the Brookdale Foundation Group, which contributed $50,000; two anonymous donors who gave $25,000 each, and the Exxon Corporation's gift of $30,000. In cooperation with the city department, the Brookdale Group also publishes the ''Age Base Directory,'' a national compilation of health-promotion programs for older adults. The directory is available without charge from the foundation, at 126 East 56th Street, New York, N.Y. 10022. The Brookdale Group combines three philanthropies established in the 1920's by the late Henry L. Schwartz, a founder of Paragon Oil, and his four brothers. ''We believe firmly that new and useful methods should not remain in one spot but should be replicated,'' said the foundation's president, Stephen L. Schwartz, Henry's nephew. A third generation of family members is continuing a tradition of concern for the elderly that began, Mr. Schwartz said, ''when my uncle looked in the mirror one day and saw the gray in his hair.''\n",
            "doc 55: In the rapidly changing world of perestroika, Leonid Abalkin is not the only economist of influence. But he is apparently highly valued for his political flexibility and grace under pressure. And this year the chain-smoking 59-year old academician emerged as the expert the Soviet Prime Minister, Nikolai Ryzhkov, has charged with finding a safe path through the treacherous waters of economic change. Mr. Abalkin, the economists Abel Aganbegyan and Oleg Bogomolov and the sociologist Tatiana Zaslavskaya, were chosen in the mid-1980's to serve as a sort of economic kitchen cabinet for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. In the first heady years of reform, Mr. Aganbegyan got most of the limelight, giving interviews to the western press and publishing books in English. But while the hefty Georgian was roving Europe and America as the unofficial ambassador for perestroika, Mr. Abalkin was being installed as director of the Soviet Academy of Science's Institute of the Economy - a bastion of establishment power. And last summer Mr. Abalkin was appointed a Deputy Prime Minister. Some western economists who heard Mr. Abalkin lecture on economic change in 1986 were not overly impressed. He showed little understanding, they said, of how free market economies worked, and little appreciation for the difficulties in making the transition from central planning. But he reportedly managed to build easy working relationships with both party bigwigs and more reform-minded elements of the Soviet bureaucracy. And in recent months Mr. Abalkin has been soaking up economic wisdom from Western economists ranging from the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, to Ed Hewett, a Brookings Institution Fellow. In November he presented a frank analysis of the Soviet Union's economic predicament to a conference of senior Soviet economists. ''The past four years of strenuous efforts,'' he acknowledged, ''have not led to any of the projected results. Far from improving, the situation continues to deteriorate.'' The detailed plan Mr. Abalkin presented to the economists' conference, and later approved as legislation, keeps in place a variety of price controls for years to come. But it also formally acknowledges that the private market is ''the most democratic form of regulating economic activity.'' And it advocates wholesale adoption of capitalist institutions ranging from an open stock market to the control of demand with monetary policy. Is it intellectually consistent? Perhaps not. But consistency may prove to be the least important of virtues to one of perestroika's hard-pressed champions who in the view of pessimists, are one stumble away from economic anarchy.\n",
            "doc 56: The gaffe was monstrous, the price paid for it enormous. Afterward, Coach Roger Neilson's mistake, the one that made Pittsburgh's tying goal possible and its subsequent 5-4 victory almost inevitable, was explained, analyzed and rehashed again and again. It just could not be excused. And for the Rangers, it just as surely could not be taken back. The calamity occurred with 11 minutes 18 seconds to go in the third period yesterday afternoon at Madison Square Garden. The Rangers, without a victory in 10 consecutive games, led by 4-3 when Kris King caught Jim Johnson in the face with his stick. Referee Terry Gregson, after consulting with his linesmen, assessed King a major penalty for slashing and ejected him from the game for opening two cuts on Johnson's face. Johnson, who had stormed after Gregson when the referee initially hesitated in making the call, was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct. No Man in the Box The incident and the ruling left the Rangers having to play a man short for three minutes. Neilson, incensed over the call, argued, screamed, steamed and slammed doors, but he never put a man in the box to serve the penalty in King's place and then enter the game. ''It was all my fault,'' Neilson said of his oversight. ''I didn't realize it until there were 20 seconds to go in the penalty.'' It was a sinking realization, and the disaster it foretold happened just 48 seconds later. With no stop in the action, the Rangers, forced to continue with just four skaters despite the fact that the penalty had officially ended, watched in horror as Mario Lemieux concluded 28 additional seconds with the man advantage by burying a shot from the right face-off circle. ''We were arguing so much over the penalty call that we just didn't think of it,'' Neilson said, staring at the floor in embarrassment. ''I have to take the blame for it. I'm just not sure what else can happen to a team.'' 'It's Unbelievable' Twenty seconds after Lemieux's goal, the Rangers, crestfallen and confused, gave up a two-on-one break, and Mark Recchi slid the puck past Bob Froese to make the score 5-4. For the Penguins, the goal essentially ended the game. For the Rangers, the loss closed out a decade of mediocre hockey with a brutal, enervating defeat. ''It's unbelievable,'' Kelly Kisio said of the futile play and miserable fate that has attended the streak, now at 11. ''I've never seen anything like it. It's beyond me. It can, though, always get worse.'' The Penguins, to a man, said they did not realize Neilson's critical mistake until the penalty expired and no one emerged from the box across the ice. Then, however, they immediately started yelling and in short order set up their power play. ''I heard people scream that the penalty was over, but I didn't see anyone coming out,'' said Paul Coffey, who eventually assisted on Lemieux's goal. ''But you know, things like that do happen. A bad break for them on that goal. A lucky bounce for us on the next goal. These things do happen.'' Monopoly on Bad Breaks Right now, though, the Rangers have a monopoly on bad breaks. ''The game was probably over if they killed that penalty,'' Lemieux said. ''They had momentum.'' In their locker room when the game was over, the Rangers, only 2 points above fifth place in the Patrick Division, had only blank stares on their faces. Neilson, whose failure to put a man in the box had prolonged an Edmonton power play earlier this season, addressed the team after the final buzzer and apologized for his error. ''I feel bad for Roger; I feel bad for us,'' Froese said. ''We're a team, a team of humans. If it wasn't for mistakes, the world would be a dull place.'' The game yesterday, in keeping with the tradition of nasty contests between the two teams, was anything but boring. There were a crazy collection of goals and a raft of regrettable fights, and it ended with Lemieux requiring stitches and Gregson nearly requiring the police to halt a potential riot as both teams emptied their benches. ''What can you say?'' asked Brian Leetch, who scored his first goal in 22 games to give the Rangers a 1-0 lead in the first period. ''Another game that we needed to win that we lost.'' Tale of the Tape The Rangers insisted afterward that replays demonstrated King was innocent of intentionally sticking Johnson. ''He fell into my stick,'' King said. ''It was stupid.'' Johnson retorted: ''He took his stick and raked my face. The guy knew what he was doing.''\n",

            "doc 58: In the world's stock markets, 1989 was a year of the unexpected. The year's biggest surprise - the startling political changes in Eastern Europe - dramatically shifted the focus of investors to the markets in Europe, which had already benefited from the transformation of Communist governments in the Eastern bloc. The main beneficiary, West Germany's Bund, is surging, and rose more than 4 percent just last Wednesday. After ranking 19th of 20 national markets at the end of March, on a Morgan Stanley & Company index of selected stocks, West Germany is ending the year in second place, trailing only Austria but leading all of the other major industrial economies. The Japanese stock market, which has outperformed the world's stock markets for years, again hit record highs, even surpassing the predictions of a year earlier. But to the surprise of many, the world's other markets performed even better than Tokyo's. Relative Decline for Japan For the first time since 1982, the growth in the rest of the world's markets surpassed that of Japan's in dollar terms, according to the Morgan Stanley index. Japan, which was the top performer among major industrial economies in the 1988 index, had the market with the smallest gain in dollar terms last year. On the basis of local currencies, markets in Europe, the United States and many much smaller countries easily outperformed Japan's. In terms of the United States currency, the dollar's strength against the yen makes the rankings more dramatic, with Japan falling to 19th among all nations, from 5th a year ago. The performance of the United States' market was also unexpected. Buoyed by economic growth that was stronger than predicted, and by inflation that was lower than expected in the first three quarters, American equities finished the year ranked 9th in dollar terms, up from 12th a year ago. Recovery From the Downturn Like European markets, stocks in the United States seemed to shrug off the sharp downturn of Oct. 13, when the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 190 points. But the outlook for the American market in 1990 has been clouded by expectations that the economy will continue to slow and that corporate earnings will be disappointing. In addition, the strength of the dollar - and now the rise of the West German mark - has had a significant impact on investors' returns from the world's stock markets. The fall of the dollar against the mark and other European currencies at the end of the year sharply enhanced gains from European investments when they are translated back into dollars. But the continued weakness of the British pound and the Japanese yen against the dollar and the mark have eroded what would have been good returns in those markets. Over all, the gains in the world markets were slower than a year ago, continuing the generally declining growth rate of recent years. Without the United States, the world index grew 9.7 percent in 1989, compared with 25.8 percent in 1988 and 22.8 percent in 1987. And analysts expect the slowing to continue this year. ''I don't expect 1990 to be as good as 1989, for the simple reason that we have had tremendous returns from the stock markets for five years in a row, and you can't expect that to continue forever,'' said Sandor Cseh, senior vice president in charge of international investments at Provident Capital Management Inc. in Philadelphia. Lower Growth in Fund John Ford, exective vice president of Rowe, Price, Fleming International in London, said he expects the company's international stock fund to show a 15 percent return this year, compared with 24 percent in 1989. ''It's really the innate caution of a fund manager who has had a good year,'' Mr. Ford said. ''You can't expect to see 24 percent every year.'' George Noble, the portfolio manager for the Fidelity Overseas Fund, is even more cautious. He said expectations that interest rates might rise further in Europe and Japan to slow economic growth and fight inflation were not good for equities. ''If we are going to make much money next year we have to have some help from interest rates,'' he said. Still, these and other analysts think there are plenty of good stocks available to investors, especially if the focus is more on individual stocks than on the overall market of one country. But Mr. Ford and Mr. Noble say Americans still do not take full advantage of the profit potential overseas. Small Markets Show Strength As a whole, 1989 was a good year for investments in small companies and small stock markets. Another strong area was the emerging markets, including Mexico, the Philippines and Thailand. Mexico, which was up 79.9 percent in 1989, was helped by the debt-reduction agreement reached with its foreign bankers. The Philippines was doing well until the recent coup attempt, and rose 63 percent in the year. And Thailand, which has been helped by a long period of economic growth in Southeast Asia, was up 103.3 percent. Some of these markets could continue to be attractive, although many are open to foreign investors only through closed-end mutual funds known as country funds. Austria was the top performer of the year, according to the Morgan Stanley index, with its market rising by 102.1 percent in dollar terms after a 1.4 percent decline in 1988. Analysts said much of the rise resulted from a few stocks, including that of Creditanstalt, Austria's largest bank. As in West Germany, much of the gain came from the opening of Eastern Europe and economic change in the Soviet Union. In both, the Austrians play a leading role as middlemen and lenders. Shift From Equities Japan's relatively weak performance - growth of just 1.5 percent in dollar terms - was a reflection of three factors. One is that equities have become so overvalued in Japan that many investors looked outside the country for more attractive opportunities. This buying abroad clearly helped the American market earlier this year and is now bolstering the market in West Germany. According to November trade figures for Japan, the American share of Japanese investment abroad fell to 9.8 percent, from 46 percent in October. The West German share of Japanese investments rose to 28 percent, from 1.9 percent. In addition, Yuichi Kohashi, executive vice president at Daiwa Securities America in New York, said that many Japanese investors switched to small-company stocks in 1989 and that many of these are not included in the indexes used to monitor the world's stock markets. ''One of the major characteristics of the Japanese market is that small companies are doing quite well,'' he said. The shift to these companies, he said, comes as investors focus more on fundamentals, including earnings. In the past, much emphasis was given to interest-sensitive stocks, like well-known companies, and the need for stocks that can be easily traded, providing liquidity. Also weighing on the market, he said, was the political scandal involving the Recruit Company, which toppled the Government of Noboru Takeshita, and uncertainity about the future of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Weakness of the Yen A third factor was the weakness of the yen against the dollar. In local currency, the Japanese market is up 16.1 percent for the year. But with a 15 percent depreciation in the yen this year, that gain is slashed to 1.5 percent in dollar terms. West Germany is the focus of most analysts, although some think the current run-up in the market may soon force a correction. The changes in East Germany and Eastern Europe mean more skilled and less expensive labor, new markets and, especially, new investment opportunities. With the Japanese already beginning to move investments from the United States to West Germany, the favorable perception of that market should add to its attractiveness. Analysts are also favorable on other markets, like that of France, which will be helped some by changes in Eastern Europe and the increasing corporate activity in preparation for the dropping of economic barriers in Europe in 1992. But some analysts like Mr. Noble tend to concentrate more on individual stocks. These include Compagnie Generale d'Electricite, the French industrial group that is involved in telecommunications, transportation and energy; Erickson, the Swedish telecommunications company, and its subsidary, Setemer, in Italy. Some Buys in Britain Even in Britain, the market that most analysts urge avoiding for the first half of 1990, there are some recommended buys. Mr. Noble, for example, holds Guinness P.L.C. And Stephen Beinhacker, assistant vice president for international strategy at Shearson Lehman Hutton, is holding his positions in Continental Europe for the first half of the year, but is ready to pick up bargains in Britain in the second half. In 1989, the British market rose 30.6 percent, ranking seventh in terms of local currencies, with most of the growth in the first quarter. But after the pound's sharp decline against the dollar is factored in, the gain for the American investor was cut to 16.2 percent, a 13th-place ranking. The top performer of 1988, Belgium, fell to 14th last year, showing how much impact one stock can have. A battle to take over Societe Generale de Belgique, by the Italian financier Carlo de Benedetti, had propelled Belgium to No. 1 in 1988.\n",
            "doc 59: The Los Angeles Rams made big pass plays today, two of them for touchdowns. They ran for 144 yards, including a 54-yard sprint by Greg Bell, which set up the clinching touchdown. Their offensive line and defensive gimmicks also contibuted mightily as they upset the Philadelphia Eagles, 21-7. When the Rams had the ball, their veteran offensive line controlled the Eagles' celebrated front four, gave Jim Everett enough time to pass and allowed Bell to carry 27 times for 124 yards. When the Eagles had the ball, the Rams' pass defense, which ranked last this season in the National Football League, kept them pinned. Injuries had decimated the Rams' defensive line, so in passing situations, they used five linebackers, six defensive backs and no defensive linemen. And they played a zone defense on every play, never covering man to man. ''I think that frustrated Randall Cunningham,'' Coach John Robinson of the Rams said. The Eagles' quarterback agreed. ''They took our wideouts away and our passing game away,'' Cunningham said. ''We've got to get down the field deep.'' Next Weekend's Matchups By winning the National Conference wild-card playoff, the Rams advanced to a playoff game against the Giants next Sunday at Giants Stadium. The 49ers will face the Minnesota Vikings on Saturday in San Francisco in the other conference playoff game. The winners of those two games will meet the following Sunday for the conference championship. That winner will meet the American Conference champion Jan. 28 in Super Bowl XXIV at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans. The Rams and the Eagles finished the regular season last Sunday with 11-5 records. The Eagles were 2 1/2-point favorites today, partly because they were playing at home and partly because in previous years the Rams' playoff record in cold weather was 0-9. The weather here was unfit for a team from southern California. The game was played in a 35-degree drizzle with a light wind and fog. The field was so icy and slippery that in the first quarter Cunningham switched a shoe, putting a white one with better traction on his right foot to go with the black shoe on his left. The uncomfortable team, however, was not the Rams but the hometown Eagles. The crowd of 57,869 at Veterans Stadium fidgeted as the Rams took charge immediately and threatened to run away with the game. Fast Start for Rams In the first five minutes, Everett completed 4 of 4 passes for 108 yards and a touchdown. By the end of the first quarter, he was 7 of 11 for 173 yards and 2 touchdowns. At that stage, the Rams had a 14-0 lead and the Eagles had a total offense of minus-2 yards. Up to then, the Rams were overwhelming. They had taken the opening kickoff and driven 83 yards in 5 plays. The touchdown came on Everett's 39-yard pass to Henry Ellard, who outjumped Izel Jenkins for the ball. The next time the Rams had the ball, they drove 46 yards in 7 plays, the last 4 yards coming on Everett's pass to Damone Johnson. The game appeared to be a runaway, but the Rams' offensive momentum faded. ''It was human error,'' Everett said, ''my interception, Greg's fumble.'' ''All of a sudden,'' Robinson said, ''there was a lot of 'uh oh' going on.'' The Eagles finally got moving in the late third and early fourth quarters on Cunningham's short passes. They finished an 80-yard drive with Anthony Toney's 1-yard run, and they were back in the game trailing by 14-7. But with three minutes left in the game, the Rams gave themselves breathing room. From their 36-yard line, on second down with 10 yards to go for a first down, Bell ran to the Eagles' 10. Two plays later, he ran 7 yards for an insurance touchdown. The 54-yard run was a straight I-formation dive up the middle. The Eagles called a blitz on the play, with Al Harris, an outside linebacker, going inside and Clyde Simmons, a defensive end, acting as a blitzing linebacker. When Bell cut, Harris tried to fill the hole. Bell dipped to the outside and was gone until Jenkins caught him. ''One player had containment,'' said Coach Buddy Ryan of the Eagles, ''and instead of keeping it, he tried to make a play and he didn't make a play and the guy made a long run. That came from just trying to make something happen, and you can't get down on something like that because we were trying to win the ball game and that was about the only way we could do it.'' Throwing Quickly Seven weeks ago, the Rams whipped the Giants, 31-10, with a controlled passing offense. Here, as he did against the Giants, Everett threw quickly to avoid the Eagles' normally strong pass rush. At first, he picked on Eric Everett (no relation), who had started at cornerback for the ailing Eric Allen. When the replacement was burned, Allen entered the game on an ailing ankle. The Rams completed two short square-out passes in front of him, then avoided him most of the time. The stars of the Eagles' defense are Reggie White, an ordained minister, and Jerome Brown. Between them, they made 13 tackles, 2 assists and 2 sacks, but they seldom harassed the passer. Jackie Slater and Irv Pankey, the Rams' offensive tackles, helped keep them away. ''Reggie is the type who dominates people,'' Slater said, ''but we kept him from that. He's paid handsomely to do that, not because he's a big, good-looking guy who loves the Lord.'' ''We knew they would try to intimidate us,'' Pankey said. ''We're from California. We're the flower children and all that stuff. But we don't take that garbage. It works on a younger line, but we've been together 10 years.'' Brown had another theory. ''We stunk,'' he said, ''and now our season's over. It'll sink in next week when I don't have to go out there and take a shot in my shoulder.'' So now the warm-weather Rams, who won in Foxboro, Mass., last Sunday and here today, will make another trip East to play the Giants in East Rutherford, N.J. Everett said he did not mind. ''If that's the price we have to pay,'' he said, ''let's try it.'' The Numbers The Rams' offense outgained the Eagles', 409 yards to 306, and the Rams' defense made two interceptions and two fumble recoveries. Everett completed 16 of 33 passes for 281 yards, Cunningham 24 of 40 for 238 yards. Kevin Greene led the Rams' defense with five tackles, two sacks and one fumble recovery.\n",

            "doc 61: Former President Chun Doo Hwan testified for the first time today about his repressive eight-year martial rule over South Korea, but he was cut short as a melee broke out in the National Assembly and walked out amid screams, curses and shoving. Nonetheless, Mr. Chun's appearance in Seoul after more than a year in self-imposed exile appears likely to quiet, if not end, the country's struggle to come to terms with the corruption and abuses under his leadership. His summoning to the well of the assembly seemed to serve a symbolic purpose for South Koreans in their halting moves away from authoritarian rule. Tonight, Mr. Chun's successor, President Roh Tae Woo, urged South Koreans to forget their recent past. ''Since we are now entering the 90's, the controversy that so dissipated our energy and blocked our progress for the past two years must now be ended,'' said Mr. Roh, who won the presidency over a divided opposition after a year of demonstrations and violence in 1987 forced the Government to hold free elections, Leave Judgment to History Speaking about Mr. Chun, who was a fellow military officer and his political mentor, Mr. Roh said: ''If there are insufficient aspects in his testimony, they should be left for history to clarify. This matter must now be brought to a definite end.'' As he left the National Assembly under heavy guard late tonight, Mr. Chun said he ''accepted responsibility'' for misdeeds during his rule, and said that ''I'm ready to go to prison if that is what is required.'' But it seems unlikely that he will be prosecuted. Mr. Chun had been expected to testify for more than 10 hours today about topics ranging from the coup that brought him to power a decade ago to his involvement, and Mr. Roh's, in the violent 1980 Government suppression of protests in Kwangju that left hundreds dead. But increasingly heated disputes on the floor of the assembly forced more than half a dozen recesses, and by the end of the day, Mr. Chun had testified for less than two hours. An Opponent Is Angered Tonight, as Mr. Chun attempted to resume testimony, Lee Chul Yong, a young opposition member of the assembly who was a witness to the Kwangju violence, charged up to the lectern where the former President was describing why troops opened fire at Kwangju. ''Chun Doo Hwan, you murderer!'' Mr. Lee yelled, as members of the governing Democratic Justice Party leaped to restrain him. A scuffle followed, and Mr. Chun was led to a side room just before a heavy metal name plate was thrown at his lectern by another opposition lawmaker. After that incident, the governing party demanded an apology, and when none was forthcoming, Mr. Chun refused to re-enter the chamber. Opposition parties declared that Mr. Chun has been ''insincere'' in his testimony, which came after a year of negotiations over how he would answer questions about abuses during his rule. Advice of Leading Dissident ''He should tell the truth, repent, and then we are ready to forgive Chun,'' said Kim Dae Jung, the country's leading opposition politician and head of the Party for Peace and Democracy, who was under house arrest during Mr. Chun's time in power. In an interview tonight, Mr. Kim added that ''today, unfortunately, there was no sign of repentence, no truth.'' Nonetheless, Mr. Chun appeared to win more public approval with his testimony than did the opposition members, who spent most of the day in televised shouting matches. ''Chun may be winning some sympathy,'' a leading member of one of the opposition parties conceded tonight. The 57-year old Mr. Chun remained impassive and tightly self-composed during today's turmoil, lecturing to the assembly in the factual, flat tones of a former general. He refused to offer specific answers to the written questions submitted to him in advance, and instead read from a script that addressed some of the issues and avoided most crucial specifics, including who ordered the shootings at Kwangju. At one point, Mr. Chun said that details that are too sensitive to discuss today would one day be revealed in his memoirs. Interrogation Falters Because of the disruptions, Mr. Chun was never asked any follow-up questions, though the elaborately negotiated testimony called for such interrogation. Outside the assembly building, a city accustomed to regular clashes between students and the police was unusually quiet. Five thousand riot policemen had spread through the streets, but there were no demonstrations. Still, the spectacle of the once-feared Mr. Chun under compulsory testimony captivated millions of people here, and they watched on television sets in small shops, department store windows and living rooms throughout the country. By late in the day, however, many Koreans said they were tired of the bickering, and the Korean Broadcasting System announced that it had been flooded with calls demanding the resumption of New Year's Eve programming. To Just 'Move On' ''At this point, the testimony itself is anticlimactic,'' said Han Sung Joo, a political science professor at Korea University. ''People just want to get it over with, and move on to other problems, like the economy.'' What the opposition was waiting for, however, was an apologetic tone, and they did not receive it. ''If he would have repented, then we could have moved forward,'' Kwan Hun Sung, a member of the Reunification Democratic Party said. ''Since he didn't, we are still caught in the past.'' In his testimony, Mr. Chun denied that his assumption of power in Decvember 1979, two months after the assasination of President Park Chung Hee, constituted a coup. At the time, Mr. Chun was leading the investigation into President Park's assassination, and he said he was forced to act quickly after learning that a higher-ranking officer was planning a coup in cooperation with Mr. Park's assassin. Mr. Chun's description of his hurried assumption of power tended to exonerate Mr. Roh, who was also a senior army officer at the time. Mr. Roh's opponents have charged that he had plotted the 1979 Government takeover with Mr. Chun long in advance. Mr. Chun said little about the Kwangju incident. He obliquely suggested that the protesters prompted the widespread shootings by inciting the troops. But he was quickly shouted down by opposition members. Rationalizations Deplored The chairman of one of the sessions, Hwang Myung Soon, lectured Mr. Chun. ''You sound more like you are explaining that you did well,'' he said after an unapologetic-sounding Mr. Chun said he had been unaware of widespread corruption and extortion among his aides. During his rule, Mr. Chun was deeply feared and often hated. He maintained absolute control over the Korean Central Intelligence Agency and other groups that tortured dissidents and spied on enemies, and his brother and other relatives amassed fortunes from bribes and extortion. Mr. Chun's brother, Chun Kyung Hwang, is now in jail. Nonetheless, Mr. Chun struck something of a sympathetic figure today. ''I felt very sorry for this man, because he looked repenting, and I think he has been punished,'' said Y. P. Park, a 46-year old owner of a tailor shop in downtown Seoul. ''Just seeing him testify is something of significance,'' he said. Mr. Chun's future now is unclear. Tonight he returned to the monastery where he has lived with his wife in seclusion for the last year. But there was widespread speculation that now that he has testified he will move back to Seoul, where he owns a house. Today he said: ''I have no where to run. I will never leave Korea. I want to be remembered as a person who does not have to live in shame.''\n",
            "doc 62: As New England's coldest December on record shivered to a close, lawmakers and consumer advocates called for an investigation into heating-oil prices that have shot up with the mercury's fall. The average price for home heating oil in Massachusetts was $1.41 a gallon on Wednesday, up from $1.10 on Dec. 18 and 88 cents a year ago. Similar price changes were reported across New England. By the end of last week, the Federal Government had been asked to investigation the situation by governors or other state officials in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont. In addition, some of those states have started their own investigation and have taken steps to insure adequate oil supplies. Many officials and experts say the sudden, steep increases could not be merely the result of cold weather's pushing up demand, but instead may be caused by price manipulations. Highest Prices in History ''Prices are higher in Boston now than at any time in history,'' said Steven Cowell, executive director of Fair Share Development Corporation, which runs a nonprofit fuel cooperative in Boston. ''Retail prices are ranging from $1.45 to $1.60, which is a 100 percent increase in some cases,'' Mr. Cowell said. His group has asked Gov. Michael S. Dukakis to declare a fuel emergency. The demand for heating oil was up 30 percent nationwide in December, said Joseph Lastelic, a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group with headquarters in Washington. He said the higher costs are being generated by longer hours at refineries and overtime for transportation workers. In addition, he said, the price of crude oil has been driven up by the increased demand. Hotline Sizzles in Vermont In Vermont, complaints on the consumer hotline were so persistent that Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin wrote to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh requesting an investigation of ''the extraordinary increase in the price of home heating oil,'' said a spokesman, Peter Freyne. ''The price has doubled in the last two weeks,'' he added, citing the increase from 79 cents to $1.39 a gallon. New Hampshire officials, while urging conservation, are also trying to increase supplies of oil as well as propane and natural gas, a spokesman for Gov. Judd Gregg said. ''We have seen a 62 percent increase in oil prices in less than a month,'' said the spokesman, Warren Henderson. The last officially measured price was $1.45 a gallon, although there have been reports of prices higher than $1.50. In Maine, a study panel on Home Heating Oil Prices was created last week to investigate the increases. Prices there have risen 50 percent in the last three weeks. a spokeswoman for Gov. John R. McKernan Jr. said. Last week, in calling for a Federal investigation, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York said home heating oil ''is a necessity, not a luxury, and these dramatic increases, coupled with unusually cold weather, will have a serious economic impact on many New York families, especially those living on fixed incomes.'' Panicky Homeowners Blamed Some experts and officials say homeowners, panicking at the possibility of an unheated house, are partly to blame for the price surge. ''It's the same type of thing as when there were long lines to buy gas,'' said John Hunt, vice president of Citizens Resources, an oil-trading division of the nonprofit Citizens Energy Corporation in Boston. ''People said, 'I better not drive around on a quarter of a tank because I don't know when I'll be able to buy more.' Probably now homeowners are asking for deliveries when their tank is not completely out or they anticipate it running out. I don't know how you correct it.'' Temperatures in New England hovered in the subfreezing range throughout December. In Boston, the National Weather Service declared last month the coldest December since record-keeping began in 1871. The average mean temperature for the month was 21.1 degrees, which broke the record of 22.2 degrees for 1876.\n",
            "doc 63: With Drexel Burnham Lambert's ''junk bond'' money machine sputtering, Frederick H. Joseph now faces the challenge of navigating the firm through what may be its toughest time in the market. Mr. Joseph, the firm's chief executive, led the investment house through its most tumultuous year to date in 1989, in which Drexel settled charges of securities law violations with the Government and agreed to the most sweeping changes ever to be required as part of a settlement of securities charges. Along the way, some of the firm's best talent, including Michael R. Milken, the head of the junk bond operation, have left the firm or stepped aside from their duties becauuse of the Government investigation, which stemmed from information provided by Ivan F. Boesky, the fallen arbitrager. Mr. Milken, who almost single-handedly moved Drexel from a second-tier player to a Wall Street power in the 1980's, was indicted last year on 98 counts of racketeering, mail fraud, insider trading, and other charges. At least one other Drexel employee is expected to be indicted early this year. The changes at Drexel last year were so extensive that almost half of the people who began 1989 at the firm are no longer there. During the year, The firm's work force was reduced to about 5,500. Shortly after the firm settled charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Joseph announced to his more than 10,000 employees that Drexel would be selling the retail brokerage division, which had never been a significant source of profit. After more than two years of being urged to stand by the firm during the investigations, many of the brokers felt they had been sold out. As the reorganization seemed to be nearing completion, the junk bond market, where Drexel still has its best franchise, began to become unstuck. Within a few months, Drexel's financial position deteriorated so quickly that executives at the firm said that it would probably close 1989 with only a slight profit or break-even. Throughout the year Mr. Joseph had to deal with questions on Wall Street about his responsibility during the time when the Government says crimes were being committed at Drexel. But the 59-year-old chairman, who has been with Drexel since 1974, received strong support from colleagues and officials in the Government who said that he was a crucial player in eliminating the firm's problems. ''It's been a difficult year,'' Mr. Joseph said. ''My view is that the most difficult parts are behind us, and we came through it with the critical assets intact.'' Drexel's future largely depends on the recovery of the junk bond market. After leading Drexel through more than two years of investigation by the Government, Mr. Joseph's new challenge will be to lead the firm through the changing marketplace.\n",
            "doc 64: With a third of the National Basketball Association season completed, the Knicks' 20-7 record is tops in the Eastern Conference and second-best over all in the 27-team league after the Los Angeles Lakers' 21-6. If the Knicks still have the best conference record after the next 15 games, Stu Jackson will be the coach of the East team in the 40th N.B.A. All-Star Game, Feb. 11 in Miami. The coaches of the teams with the best conference records through the games of Jan. 28 coach the All-Star teams. Through Saturday's games, the Knicks had the best record in the East, a game and a half ahead of the Chicago Bulls and the Indiana Pacers. The Bulls and the Pacers are tied at 19-9 for the Central Division lead, but the 18-11 Detroit Pistons and the 16-11 Atlanta Hawks should not be counted out. Stu Jackson and the Bulls' Phil Jackson are first-year coaches. Only three rookie coaches have won the honor of coaching in the All-Star Game. Easy Ed McCauley of the St. Louis Hawks accomplished the feat in 1959; Billy Cunningham of the Philadelphia 76ers did it in 1978, and Pat Riley of the Lakers did so in 1982. Knicks on a Streak Unlike the Jacksons, none of those three started the season with their teams but were instead replacements for dismissed coaches. McCauley took over for Andy Phillips after 10 games, Cunningham replaced Gene Shue after 6 games and Riley succeeded Paul Westhead after 11 games. The Knicks extended their winning streak to nine games Saturday by beating the Orlando Magic, 113-107, and ran their Madison Square Garden unbeaten streak to 12 games. The team's last five victories were against teams with sub-.500 records, but the Knicks' schedule this month will pair them against some of the toughest teams in the league. Between tonight's game against the Phoenix Suns at the Garden and Jan. 28, 8 of the Knicks' 15 games will be on the road, where they are 8-7. With the exception of a contest with the Houston Rockets, each of the Knicks' games in January will be against a team with a current record better than .500. The Knicks will play home and away games against David Robinson and the San Antonio Spurs (19-7) and Michael Jordan and the Bulls, who have won 9 of their last 11 games. 'Honest With Players' Al Bianchi, the Knicks' general manager, said the other day he was surprised ''we have done so well, considering we went to the West Coast twice in the first month of the season.'' But Bianchi was not surprised that Jackson ''had established himself as a star among coaches.'' Last July, Bianchi was criticized when he promoted Jackson, then a 33-year-old assistant, to replace Rick Pitino. Jackson, who is the youngest N.B.A. coach, began his coaching career eight years ago. ''One of Stu's qualities,'' Bianchi said, ''is that he has a good feel for people. He is honest with his players and they have developed a trust in him. I learned a long time ago from Alex Hannum, my first pro coach, that you didn't have to like a coach but he had to know how to communicate with his players and gain their trust. Stu is a communicator. He's fair.'' Where Pitino was fiery and volatile, Jackson is calm and subtle. 'Calm and Relaxed' ''We're a very calm and relaxed team,'' said Trent Tucker, the senior Knick player, in his eighth season. ''Stu is so calm, it rubs off on us. By comparision, Rick had a tendency to be hyper and at times so were we.'' Jackson has shown himself to be a solid teacher of fundamentals, especially defensive ones. And he has such confidence that he has been able to win games with bold strategies and personnel combinations. He has used big lineups and small lineups, played three guards at a time and has used both Mark Jackson and Strickland as the playmaker. Most important, the Knicks have come to know that the coach has no favorites: playing time is decided by who is playing the best. As Gerald Wilkins put it, ''He has us believing in ourselves.''\n",

            "doc 66: United States officials in Panama who thought they had captured Mike Harari, an Israeli identified as a close associate of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, may have mistaken the Israeli's driver for Mr. Harari, Administration officials said today. The report that Mr. Harari was in United States custody was retracted on Saturday by the same senior American Embassy official in Panama who had issued it on Thursday. The official said the United States military either captured the wrong man or detained Mr. Harari but released him after ''he convinced them he was someone else.'' White House and Pentagon officials in the United States did not confirm the initial report. But the reported detention of Mr. Harari caused some official embarrassment in Washington because it was hailed by the new Panamanian Government as a major development. Crossed Diplomatic Signals The erroneous report, which officials said was a result of crossed signals between diplomatic and military officials in Washington, prompted the Justice Department to send a premature query to the Israeli Foreign Ministry asking whether they had any pending criminal charges against Mr. Harari, officials said. After the embassy in Panama reported Mr. Harari's purported capture to the State Department in Washington on Thursday, ''State informed Justice, and Justice sent a query to the Israelis,'' an Administration official said. But the Justice Department learned that Mr. Harari was not wanted in Israel, officials said. On further investigation, they said, the department determined that there were no criminal charges or indictments pending against him in this country. 'There Was Some Confusion' Administration officials in Washington said the origins of the report of Mr. Harari's capture were not clear. One official said it may have been a case of mistaken identity. ''They had a guy who was Harari's driver and there was some confusion,'' the official said. In Israel today, television reports quoted people close to Mr. Harari's family as saying he was in Israel. The report gave no elaboration and said Mr. Harari's family wanted to maintain its privacy and would have no immediate comment. Mr. Harari, 62 years old, retired in 1979 as head of Mossad, Israel's intelligence service, in Central America and Mexico. Starting in the early 1980's, he was General Noriega's commercial attache and honorary consul in Tel Aviv. He is known to have recruited and trained the general's personal security detail and is reputed to have made millions in illicit business ventures with the deposed Panamanian strongman.\n",
            "doc 67: Nicolae Ceausescu's brief and vain attempt to escape capture was described today by his helicopter pilot as a scrambled flight in which crew members were held at gunpoint and one of them sat in the Rumanian dictator's lap. The pilot, Lieut. Col. Vasile Malutan, said that at one point he had told Mr. Ceausescu that their aircraft had been spotted by radar and would probably be shot down. ''That frightened him,'' Colonel Malutan said, and led to an order to land immediately. Once on the ground, he said, the toppled dictator, his wife, Elena, and two security guards stopped a passing car, ordered its four occupants to get out and then drove off. Soon afterward, the Ceausescus were spotted in Tirgoviste, 45 miles northwest of Bucharest, and according to some accounts were surrounded by peasants and soldiers. They were arrested, reportedly consigned to an armored car and three days later, on Dec. 25, executed by a firing squad. Most Complete Account Details of the attempted escape, the most complete to come to light so far, were included in an interview with the pilot published today in Rumania Libera, one of the newspapers that sprang up after Mr. Ceausescu's ouster. The pilot, an 18-year veteran, said he and two other crew members had been ordered to fly their helicopter from the Bucharest Airport and land it on the roof of the downtown headquarters of the Communist Party's Central Committee. He said they did not realize what was happening until they saw a crowd surging toward the roof. At the same moment, the Ceausescus were being hustled - almost carried, Colonel Malutan said - to the helicopter by their bodyguards. Accompanying them were two party loyalists who are now under arrest, identified as Emil Bobu and Manea Manescu. There was not room for them all, and as a result, the pilot said, his mechanic ''had to be seated in the dictator's lap.'' Their first destination was Snagov, a town 20 miles north of Bucharest where the Ceausescus had a summer retreat. Other helicopters were to meet them there. But instead, Colonel Malutan said, a superior told him over the radio that he was on his own. He was then ordered to fly to a special military airfield at Boteni, to the northwest and not far from Tirgoviste. This time, though, the overloaded helicopter had trouble taking off, so Mr. Manescu and Mr. Bobu got out. The helicopter headed to Boteni. One of the security guards ordered that there be no more radio contact and, the pilot said, pointed a machine gun at the crew. But the pilot said he maintained radio contact anyway. A few minutes later, he told Mr. Ceausescu that the helicopter had been spotted and that he had been told the Government had been overthrown. Mr. Ceausescu, he said, replied: ''No. Those are only horrible lies. Are you not serving the cause?'' But when he then told the deposed leader that they not only had been seen but were in danger of being blown up, Mr. Ceausescu became frightened and ordered that they land, which they did on a road near Boteni, he said. As Mr. Ceausescu left the helicopter, Colonel Malutan said, he asked again, ''Are you serving the cause?'' The colonel said he replied, ''Which cause should I serve?'' His last view of the man who had guided this country through 24 repressive years was of his hijacking a car and driving away.\n",

The ship, the Vulka, went down 800 miles northeast of Hawaii. The crewmen were evacuated to the Coast Guard buoy tender Sassafras on Saturday after malfunctioning pumps could not keep ahead of the flooding. The cause of the flooding has not been determined, officials said. There was no immediate estimate of the value of the ship and her cargo. Crewmen had used pumps dropped from Coast Guard planes to try to keep the ship afloat until a commercial salvage ship from Honolulu could reach the area Monday. The Sassafras also tried unsuccessfully to tow the Vulka around, away from the wind, to keep waves from washing over the bow.\n",
            "doc 70: American industry, battered by years of stiff foreign competition, has found a new ally in the technology wars: the multibillion-dollar military research program at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. An industrial consortium is being formed here to turn unclassified military research breakthroughs developed at Wright-Patterson into new commercial products. The consortium is the Ohio Advanced Technology Center. The center's officials are already in place, with offices in a research park next to the base, just outside Dayton. They will soon hire additional staff and start setting goals for specific projects. Financing for the center has come from several private and public sources. Big Institutions Attracted The technology center's potential to speed up the development of advanced commercial products has attracted several major institutions to the center's board. These include the American Telephone and Telegraph Company; Ohio State University; the Mead Corporation, a paper products and data services company based here; the Battelle Memorial Institute, a leading research organization based in Columbus, Ohio, and Cincinnati Milacron Inc., one of the nation's leading machine-tool makers. The base has long been the Air Force's principal research center. Its nine specialty laboratories do research in areas ranging from advanced materials and new manufacturing techniques to aviation electronics and jet propulsion technology. Over the years, military research has led to a wide range of civilian advances in everything from cars to medicine. Recent ones that came directly from Wright-Patterson include artificial hip joint implants made from a carbon composite developed for missile nose cones, computer-based information systems and graphite material used in golf clubs and tennis rackets. But these were more a series of happy accidents than well-planned moves to make tax-financed research pay off in nonmilitary ways. ''That's part of the problem - it's been taking too long,'' said Dr. Vince Russo, director of Wright-Patterson's materials laboratory. He noted that it took 15 years for graphite epoxy to catch on in sports equipment. Secrecy of the Past Part of the reason is that the base has carried on its innovative work with little publicity, if not in deliberate secrecy. Still, much of its research is unclassified. The problem is transferring these breakthroughs to civilian industries that could use them. The Air Force base and civilian companies aim to speed the process by using the Advanced Technology Center as home to a military, industrial and university team. ''We must form the best teams we can if we're going to compete in an international marketplace,'' said Dr. Frank Moore, program manager for the new technology center and the retired commander of the aviation electronics laboratory at Wright-Patterson. ''It's not so much that we lack technology,'' he added. ''Where we seem to fail is in moving that technology to the marketplace. You'd be hard pressed to find an American-made microwave oven. We invented it. We just didn't stay competitive.'' Nationwide Potential The largest benefits from the center's work would be aimed at an industrial triangle formed by Dayton, Cincinnati and Columbus. But if the center succeeds, American businesses nationwide will have tapped into one of the secrets that has helped power Japan's economic growth: a marriage of government and industry. The West Germans and the Japanese ''are light years ahead'' of American companies in tapping the resources of government, said Burnell R. Roberts, chairman of Mead. Mead Data Central International Inc. is an example of a commercial spinoff from a system developed for military use. Data Central operates the Lexis and Nexis information service, which allows subscribers with computer terminals to see articles that have been published in many newspapers, magazines and legal publications. Mead developed the service after it bought the Data Corporation in 1968, when Data was a small Wright-Patterson contractor that had developed a computer-based system for information storage and retrieval to help the Air Force keep track of procurement contracts and worldwide inventories of radar equipment. Major New Industries Mr. Roberts, who serves as chairman of the Technology Center's board, said tax-financed research breakthroughs at Wright-Patterson could help spawn major new industries. ''So much of the technology at Wright-Patterson has never been exposed enough that people can know where it can go,'' he said. Mr. Roberts's company has done well by the technology it gained: Data Central is now Dayton's fastest-growing employer, with a local workforce expected to reach 2,500 by the end of 1990. Revenues for 1989 are expected to reach $400 million, up from $22.9 million in 1979, according to the company. At the core of the new potential for a technological bonanza is the Air Force base named for three of the city's most famous sons - the aviation pioneers Wilbur and Orville Wright and John Patterson, the industrial genius who developed modern manufacturing procedures at National Cash Register, now the NCR Corporation. With 35,000 jobs, the base is the largest single employer in Ohio. Now, it has the potential to provide other benefits as well. ''We want to see the time and money invested in our research flood Ohio industry with new ideas,'' Lieut. Gen. Mike Loh of the Air Force told a state technology commission in October. ''Sadly, that isn't the case right now. There's a dribble going through the system, not a flood as it should.'' General Loh heads the Aeronautical Systems division, which operates Wright-Patterson's laboratories. Requests for Information The Ohio Advanced Techonology Center is not the first effort to speed the movement of technology into civilian enterprises. As a result of the Federal Technology Innovation Act of 1980, the base has long had an office to help companies seeking Government technological information. There has been no lack of requests. ''The phone rings constantly,'' said Cindy Ingalls, a civilian employee who runs the office. She handles basic industrial questions like how to avoid forming burrs when welding nickel to nickel using a spot welder with a copper tip. While that program will continue handling those types of requests, the new program will take on major development projects, hoping to spur the creation of new products and industries. If the center succeeds, United States industry will get some help in the battle with Japan and other foreign competitors. But the shifting industrial landscape in Ohio and other states has changed the definition of just what foreign competition is. Southern and central Ohio are now dotted with sizable outposts of foreign-owned companies. Most notable are those of the Honda Motor Company. With two car assembly plants and other operations, Honda has more than 9,000 workers, making it one of the state's largest employers. That raises the question of whether Honda could seek help from the new technology center. ''We really haven't addressed that,'' Mr. Roberts said. ''I would guess they would be able to use it.'' But he added that if a foreign corporation with no American ties applied for help, ''we might look at that a little differently.''\n",
            "doc 71: NOT long ago in Massachusetts, the beginning of a three-day primitive-firearms hunt for deer and the start of the second half of the state's waterfowl season coincided, plunging me into indecision. My hesitancy was born of greed. I wanted more venison in the freezer, having almost polished off the half of a big buck that a friend of mine gave me at the close of a hunt in Quebec last fall, a hunt during which I never fired a shot. Had my choice been based on hunting pleasure alone, I would have opted for ducks and geese. I enjoy deer hunting even though I am not much good at it, but waterfowling pleases me even more. I can become inattentive, even bored, when sitting on a hillside waiting for a deer to wander by. But I will shiver contentedly for hours in a wind-racked blind, eagerly searching the sky over bay or salt pond for distant birds, as frozen spray builds up on my decoys. Massachusetts allows one to take a deer of either sex during the primitive-weapon season (primitive weapons are muzzleloading), and that added opportunity, plus my brother Dan's importuning and the thought that one good-sized deer has more meat on it than 100 ducks, found me scrambling to get my black-powder rifle ready for the following morning. There wasn't time to take the rifle to a neighbor's sand pit for proper zeroing-in at 100 yards, so I used my own 30-yard range and fired at a half-gallon paint can. The bullet struck the can amidships. That was good enough for me, because I was going to spend much of my time in thick cover, a blend of scrub oaks and briars, where one can rarely see beyond 50 yards. Before sunrise the following dawn, I was on a little ridge overlooking a deer trail that came up out of a swamp. I was also wondering what madness had possessed me to agree to go deer hunting when the temperature was 8 degrees above zero and the frozen snow underfoot made it impossible for me to move without making a great deal of noise. I endured the vigil for an hour. Then I went down the deer trail through the swamp, on my hands and knees part of the time and shredding my fluorescent orange vest on briars, hoping, if nothing else, to push a deer toward Dan. I was rewarded by the distinctive half-thump, half-crack that a black-powder weapon makes when fired, and I began making plans for half of another deer. But when I encountered my brother, who had been standing on a hillock on the other side of the swamp, I learned that he had missed a long and difficult shot at a big doe. That was enough of the primitive-weapon deer season for me. Shortly after noon I was home. I shot another hole in the paint can (the easiest way to empty a muzzleloader is to fire it), swabbed out the bore with hot, soapy water, dried and oiled the rifle, and put it away until next year. By late afternoon of the next day, my guilt was sufficiently assuaged to allow a sortie to a nearby salt pond. The northwest wind moaned over miles of snow-covered ice, but a few patches of open water remained, including one that marked the channel to the entrance to a cove. When I arrived, eight black ducks burst out of the channel and flew off toward the white line of the surf. Time was running out, so I didn't give much thought to where I should place my portable blind. I chose a spot with a three-foot-high bank behind me, where I could tether the blind to the roots of bayberry bushes that had been exposed by winter storms. Then I set out five black-duck decoys. In the next 20 minutes, more than three dozen birds came by: black ducks, mallards, American mergansers, green-winged teal, and bluebills. Some of them looked at my decoys, but all stayed just out of range and continued on to the other end of the open water. It was clear that I should move my rig, but there wasn't time. Three more mergansers flew past, a little closer than before, and I dropped the one that was closest to me. More black ducks arrived, but they joined their brethren, who hadn't jumped when I fired, 200 yards away. Less than five minutes before the sunset shooting curfew, a pair of black ducks came in high from a different angle. They were nearly directly overhead before I saw them. I shot the right-hand bird. My fingers were numb by the time I had retrieved my ducks and my decoys and placed them in a burlap sack. But I was warmed by the thought that two birds in hand are more satisfying than a deer in the bush, even if one of the birds is a merganser. There was a time when I ignored mergansers because I won't shoot anything I don't plan to eat. Many waterfowlers will tell you that a merganser, often called a fish duck because of its eating habits, is poor fare. But properly handled, mergansers are just as tasty as a mallard or a black duck. If you try to roast them whole, the resulting stench will drive you from the kitchen. But the skinned breasts are excellent. Remove a few feathers so you can get hold of the skin, and pull the skin away from the breast meat. A little careful work with a filleting knife will yield two slabs of meat each weighing about a quarter of a pound. Steep the breasts in a mixture of one-fourth vinegar and three-fourths water, to which a dash of salt and ground black pepper has been added, for three hours at room temperature. Pat them dry, roll in flour, and sear in cooking oil in an extremely hot frying pan. They should be red in the middle, which means about two minutes of cooking on each side. A simple sweet-sour sauce will enhance the flavor of wild duck. Over low heat, blend a tablespoon of butter, a heaping tablespoon each of currant jelly and orange marmalade, a dash of lemon juice and a teaspoon of mustard. This will be enough for four pieces of duck breast. Wild rice is the classic side dish for waterfowl. If you want a thin gravy for the wild rice, boil the hearts and livers of the ducks in unsalted water. Then chop them fine. Add a little beef or chicken bouillon powder to about a half-cup of that stock, plus, if you wish, a few drops of Kitchen Bouquet to darken the mixture. Add the chopped livers and hearts to the half-cup of stock, and pour the mixture into the frying pan immediately after the breasts have been removed. Allow to simmer for half a minute, then transfer to a gravy bowl. If you do make such a gravy, cook the rice in unsalted water, because the bouillon and the Kitchen Bouquet are heavily salted.\n",
            "doc 72: Nicholas F. Brady, a diffident, modest, well-born Wall Streeter of whom not much was expected when President Reagan made him Treasury Secretary in November 1988, tackled some of the most difficult problems of the American and world economy in 1989 and, against heavy odds, actually achieved some success. The third world is still mired in more than $1 trillion of debt, but his plan of financial support to encourage debt reduction has already helped countries like Mexico, Costa Rica and the Philippines. He shepherded through Congress savings and loan legislation calling for outlays of $159 billion over 10 years to shut down or sell off hundreds of unhealthy savings and loans. The legislation not only came up with the funds but changed the regulatory structure so that savings and loans will have to meet higher capital standards. While the earmarked money may not cover the real losses, Mr. Brdy has been credited with birnging order to a situation that had threatened to become a full-scale financial crisis. Mr. Brady and President Bush are preparing to renew the campaign in 1990 for a lower capital gains tax, as part of what is likely to be an intensified effort to increase savings. The Treasury chief developed the concept of the Family Savings Account, an idea also designed to increase savings, which the President is expected to feature in his January economic messages to the nation. Earnings accumulated in the account, which would be available to families with income levels of up to $60,000, would be exempt from taxation if the money is left untouched for 10 years. Mr. Brady also plans to do something about double taxation of dividents - dividends taxed once as corporate profits and again as income of investors. The tall, lean, taciturn 59-year-old Treasury chief earned a masters degree in business administration from Harvard after graduation from Yale in 1952. He came to Washington after serving as co-chairman of Dillon, Read & Company, an investment house. Also on the Brady agenda for 1990 is the matter of financial market reform. The market plunge last Oct. 13 and the collapse in 1987, stirred concerns about market volatility. Mr. Brady has told lawmakers that the Treasury is preparing some proposals to address the issue.\n",
            "doc 73: The turmoil in the ''junk bond'' market that began in the middle of last year shows no sign of easing soon. ''The second half of 1989 has given us a vision of the future,'' said Michael F. Holland, the president of Salomon Asset Management, the investment management arm of Salomon Inc. The market for high-yield high-risk bonds seems to be experiencing setbacks on every front. Prices on the more speculative junk bonds have dropped steadily since last June, down by more than 20 percent. With the economy weakening, more leveraged buyouts that were financed with junk bonds are collapsing, unable to make huge debt payments. Just last week, the Hillsborough Holdings Corporation, a company formed by the leading buyout banker, Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, filed for bankruptcy protection. Hillsborough is the biggest leveraged-buyout company to enter Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, but several others have encountered serious problems, including Integrated Resources Inc., Resorts International Inc. and the Campeau Corporation. With the junk bond financing engine sputtering badly, the bankers, brokers and investors who benefited from this market's dizzying rise in the 1980's are in trouble. Michael R. Milken, who created the modern junk bond market, resigned from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. a year ago and has been indicted on charges of securities law violations and racketeering. For its part, Drexel has been battered, posting losses last year. The other Wall Street firms that followed Drexel in the junk bond market are also suffering. ''I don't think there's anybody on Wall Street who isn't sitting there with a reasonable loss,'' said Raymond J. Lemanski, the co-head of junk bond sales and trading at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Although intermittent price rallies may occur, the outlook for the once-lucrative $200 billion market for junk bonds is so shaky that most bankers and investors are just trying to limit their losses. By the end of last year, the fortunes of Drexel, which earned $2 billion in fees on its junk bond business during the 1980's, had slipped such that the Standard & Poor's Corporation, the rating agency, downgraded the firm's commercial paper, thus raising its cost of financing. Through October, the firm had an estimated operating loss of $130 million and it gave its highest-paid employees a portion of their bonuses for the end of the year in stock rather than in cash. With Drexel severely weakened and other firms pulling back from the junk bond market, the pricing of such bonds will become increasingly volatile, fund managers say. With profits from junk bonds scarce, investment bankers will commit less capital to trading in the secondary market, sapping liquidity and increasing the size of price swings in a more thinly traded market, they explain. Mr. Milken helped stabilize the market, the traders say. Critics often contended that prices in the market were inflated by Mr. Milken, who uniquely controlled the financing, distribution, secondary trading and pricing of most securities in the market. His deft shuffling of securities among issuers, traders and buyers kept prices from tumbling, the traders say. ''The absence of Milken caused the end of the synthetic liquidity he created,'' said Mr. Holland of Salomon. Is It Over?  But the prices of junk bonds are also weak, analysts say, because investors are asking whether the golden era for leveraged takeovers is over. Investors began selling these high-risk bonds in earnest last spring when they realized that corporate profits were weakening, when indebted companies received lower-than-expected prices for businesses they were selling to finance their debts, and when large investors, like mutual funds and savings and loans, began selling their portfolios. For example, the market fell sharply in June, when companies like Integrated Resources, a financial services concern, failed to make scheduled payments on their bonds and when Campeau revealed that its retailing subsidiaries lacked cash. Concerned about the ability of other highly leveraged companies to make their bond payments, investors may begin to prefer the so-called highest-quality junk bonds, analysts and traders say. And the spread between high-rated bonds like those of Duracell Inc. and troubled issues like those of the Allied Stores Corporation will probably widen further. For instance, while the overall market had a slightly positive total rate of return - price change plus interest - the highest-rated junk bonds in the Merrill Lynch High Yield Index had a total return of 12.2 percent, and the lowest-rated junk bonds showed a net decline of 13.6 percent. Here to Stay Despite its difficulties, the junk-bond market will not wither and die, the analysts agree. Institutional investors and Wall Street bankers say they will continue to provide credit for well-managed companies that, because they recently emerged from a turnaround or because of other reasons, are deemed by credit-rating agencies to be below investment grade, like the Johnston Coca-Cola Bottling Group in Tennessee, which tapped the market in September. Junk bond financing will also be available for well-structured deals like the Container Corporation of America's acquisition by the Jefferson Smurfit Corporation and a recapitalization of the combined companies, which occurred in December. And for investment bankers, the underwriting fees are significantly higher than what they would earn for distributing bonds of blue-chip corporations like the American Telephone and Telegraph Corporation and the International Business Machines Corporation. In fact, despite the periodic upheavals, the volume of new public offerings last year totaled $25.2 billion, the market's fourth-biggest year, according to the Securities Data Corporation, which tracks junk bond statistics. Some bonds of the RJR Capital Holdings Corporation, which raised $4 billion last May in the largest junk bond offering to finance the largest leveraged buyout ever, traded above their offering price at the end of the year. But the company's zero-coupon bonds and pay-in-kind securities -with interest payments made in bonds or preferred stock, not cash -fell in value, reflecting investors' fears. More Scrutiny Expected The junk bond market will probably not be a source of credit for many speculative takeovers in 1990, the market analysts say. After providing almost $68 billion in acquisition-related debt since 1985, these investors are suddenly reluctant to finance deals that require asset sales or a stronger economy to repay debt. Burned by the bonds of companies like the Seaman Furniture Company, a leading furniture retailer that had trouble meeting its debt payments, portfolio managers say they will screen new issues more carefully than in the past. ''The market has said we're not going to accept this kind of deal anymore,'' said Peter F. Karches, the head of the junk bond department at Morgan Stanley & Company. The shakeout of the junk-bond market will probably continue through this year because many of the big buyers of such bonds have become sellers - some by choice, others by necessity. Under Federal legislation enacted last August, savings and loans must sell their junk bond holdings. And market participants say they will probably continue to sell bonds throughout 1990. At mid-year, the value of the junk bonds held by nearly 200 savings institutions had declined to $13.3 billion, from $14.8 billion on March 31, according to the Office of Thrift Supervision, the agency created in the legislation to oversee the savings industry. Some savings institutions with the largest junk portfolios, like the Columbia Savings and Loan Association and the Imperial Corporation of America, took large losses when they sold bonds and marked down their remaining holdings in the second half of last year. An Uncertain Future Though mutual funds sold more junk bonds in 1989 than in the past, it is unclear what direction they will take this year. The total assets of the 103 funds that own these bonds declined to $30 billion, from $33.7 billion, because the market fell and because nervous individuals switched their assets out of these funds and into safer investments. Through November of last year, investors withdrew $7.5 billion, compared with withdrawals of $4.8 billion during the same period in 1988, according to the Investment Company Institute, a Washington trade group. Eventually, buyers are expected to emerge for junk bonds, the traders predict, if only because prices will fall enough to make these risky securities look like bargains. Some optimistic traders note that the high yields have attracted cash from so-called ''smart money'' investors like Peter Lynch, the portfolio manager of the Fidelity Magellan Fund, a long-time performance leader among fund managers. ''Junk is cheap, and when an asset class is cheap long enough, somebody steps in,'' said Mr. Karches of Morgan Stanley. But so far, the smart money has not pumped enough cash into this troubled market to offset the selling pressure by the large institutions, the traders say. Mr. Lynch, whose mutual fund totals $12 billion, has invested only $60 million in junk bonds, an amount termed ''insignificant'' by a Fidelity spokeswoman.\n",
            "doc 74: Miami trounced Alabama tonight in the USF&G Sugar Bowl, and afterward, the winning coach, Dennis Erickson, put in a claim on college football's national championship for his team. The Hurricanes won, 33-25, but the 8-point margin was a poor indicator of their superiority in the Superdome before a crowd of 77,452. The yardage total was a better reflection, 477 yards for Miami to 252 for Alabama, a co-champion of the Southeastern Conference. ''That it is now possible to win the national championship is a credit to the players and coaches,'' Erickson said. ''I think we are the best. But it's up to the people who vote.'' Those people are the reporters, broadcasters and coaches who make up the panels for the Associated Press and United Press International polls, and their choices will be revealed Tuesday. The results determine this mythical championship by acclaim. Craig Erickson, the Miami quarterback and no relation to the coach, said, ''There's not a doubt in my mind who is number one.'' Miami Quarterback Stars This Erickson was the game's offensive hero and was voted the most valuable player with three touchdown passes, 250 yards gained by passing, and able execution of the game plan. In winning its 11th game of the season against one defeat, Miami enlarged a 20-17 halftime lead to 33-17 before the Crimson Tide scored its last touchdown with 2 minutes 53 seconds to play. Miami lost only to Florida State, 24-10, and because the Hurricanes beat Notre Dame, 27-10, their clamor to be voted No. 1 in the polls must be respected. Alabama, which shared its conference championship with Auburn and Tennessee, finished with a 10-2 record. Bill Curry, its coach, said of the Hurricanes, ''They are a much better team than we are.'' That was not obvious at the start of the game but evident before halftime. The first touchdowns for both sides were set up by defensive-offsides penalties near the goal lines, blunders that turn coaches sour. The first was on an Alabama defensive back, Lee Ozmint, and the penalty moved the ball from the 7 to the 3. From there, Stephen McGuire, the Hurricane fullback, ran for a touchdown. Early in the second quarter, Miami's Russell Maryland, a defensive tackle, crossed the scrimmage line early, and the penalty took the ball from the 7 to the 3. Kevin Turner lost a yard and then Gary Hollingsworth passed to Marco Battle for the Alabama touchdown that tied the score. Quick Series of Scores The scores came quickly after that: touchdown, field goal, touchdown, touchdown, missed field goal, and halftime came with the Hurricanes ahead, 20-17. Miami's second touchdown was a passing affair. Erickson completed three to Wesley Carroll, who lined up as a flanker, for 50 yards and a score. The conversion kick by Carlos Huerta was blocked by Mike Ramil, who stands 6 feet 7 inches tall. A roughing-the-passer penalty on Alabama helped this 78-yard drive along. A fumble of a punt by Miami's Pee Wee Smith gave the Crimson Tide the ball on its opponent's 34-yard line and Phillip Doyle's 45-yard field goal came four plays later. Miami struck back with a 62-yard drive that ended with Alex Johnson's 3-yard run for a touchdown and a 20-10 lead. Keith McCants, Alabama's all-American linebacker, missed a tackle on Johnson on the 5. The Tide bounced back on an 80-yard drive, during which Hollingsworth completed six passes, the last for a 7-yard touchdown to the tight end Lamonde Russell. Ozmint's interception of a poor pass by Erickson gave Alabama an opportunity, but Doyle's 40-yard field goal attempt was wide 15 seconds before halftime. In the second half, Miami scored two more touchdowns to wrap up the decision.\n",
            "doc 75: When Doru Pavaloiae, an economist, met an old classmate on Lipscani Street here at a time when Nicolae Ceausescu was still in power in Rumania, the two men talked, and in the conversation he let slip that he would like to leave the country. The economist did not realize, however, that the man he knew as a friend and as a popular singer in his hometown was also known to the regime's pervasive security police as Minstrel, a code name supposed to disguise the identity of a paid informer. Minstrel, the economist discovered the other day, had denounced him. When Mr. Pavaloiae joined others in the revolution that overturned Mr. Ceausescu on Dec. 22, he was assigned to the storming of security-police headquarters in the city of Focsani, about 100 miles northeast of Bucharest, he said today. The force, the Securitate, was the most feared and brutal of those surrounding and protecting the Ceausescu leadership to its last. File Found in Bunker And there in the headquarters, in a bunker, he located the file that the secret police had kept on him, including the report by Minstrel to a security officer in July 1977 at an intelligence safe house code-named Rosa. It documented much about his life, including the supposed sexual activity of his first wife before their marriage, and was part of 12 years of covert surveillance, mail interceptions and telephone taps designed to determine his loyalties, his plans and the identity of those who shared his desire to leave Rumania illegally. Copies of parts of the file were brought to Bucharest today and made available to reporters by friends of Mr. Pavaloiae, who said in a telephone interview that his motive in publicizing his case was partly to unmask those, like Minstrel, who are seeking to cover their tracks now that the Government that sustained them has been ousted. Friend Against Friend The files document and reflect a society in which friend was turned against friend and huge resources were diverted to the detection of the slightest suggestion of anti-Government sentiment, and in which the security police were able to burrow into the most private corners of individual lives. That, in turn, built a mood of deep fear and suspicion among Rumanians, pre-empting open dissent until the revolution came, and leaving lingering apprehension about their future. Mr. Pavaloiae said he had not been an active dissident, and had expressed displeasure only privately among those he considered friends. Yet those indiscretions drew sufficient attention for several four-inch-thick file dossiers to be compiled on him over the years, starting even before his denounciation by Minstrel. Moreover, according to Mr. Pavaloiae and his associates from Focsani, the story built to a bizarre climax during the revolution. Minstrel had worked in the town as the leader of a band that could be hired to provide the music and singing on occasions like weddings. So he owned one of the few loudspeaker systems permitted in a town, where, as in the rest of Rumania, ordinary people could not even own a bullhorn. ''He helped us a lot - he really was a leader,'' Mr. Pavaloiae said of Minstrel, because he allowed his loudspeaker system to be used to rally support for the uprising. Only after he had been elected to a revolutionary committee running the town after the fall of President Ceausescu did other people denounce him and force him to withdraw, Mr. Pavaloiae said. Minstrel could not be contacted to comment on the chain of events depicted in the security-police files made available to reporters, but, in a letter to the local newspaper in Focsani, he objected to his dismissal from the new revolutionary committee, saying he was himself a true revolutionary. His Marriage Is Studied According to the files, which contained photocopies of intercepted letters and authorizations for phone taps, Minstrel made his first report about his friend to a Lieutenant Predescu of the security police at Safe House Rosa on July 13, 1977. The report said Mr. Pavaloiae had married a student ''under very bad conditions'' because ''she had sexual contact with many men, but he married the student because she has a very good material situation.'' It said her family was of German descent from the town of Brasov and lived in a ''very fine villa,'' according to an unofficial translation of the documents into English. Mr. Pavaloiae, it said, ''lives like a parasite and has no job.'' ''From the beginning when they were married, both of them want to leave the country and go to Germany to his wife's relatives,'' Minstrel was said to have told his security-police controller. During Mr. Ceausescu's 24 years in power, people of German descent were permitted to emigrate in return for payments from the West German Government, just thousands of Rumanian Jews were allowed to leave, an Israeli newspaper reported over the weekend, in return for cash payments by the Israeli Government. But most Rumanians were denied passports - a rule that continues despite the ouster of Mr. Ceausescu. Wiretaps Authorized The incomplete files made available to reporters here also contain authorizations for wiretaps from May 23, 1979, to Nov. 23, 1979, and from June 9, 1981, to Oct. 9, 1981. Mail intercepts included copies of letters sent from France in 1985 and 1986. The documents were marked ''classified'' on letterheads including that of the Interior Ministry, which ran the Securitate and the Department of State Security. The wiretaps were requested, according to the documents, to determine ''with what persons the target has telephone contacts, their telephone numbers, if there are discussions of a hostile character toward the policy of the party and our state policy, and if there are any indications that we can find about the intentions of the target to leave the country illegally.'' Other wiretaps were designed to find out what links the 48-year-old economist had with another resident of Focsani, identified as Edi Strautiu, according to the copies made available. An unidentified person in Strasbourg, France, in 1985, said, ''About your problem, I cannot give you good news.'' The letter did not say what the problem was. In a telephone interview, Mr. Pavaloiae said he had seen other files listing all his close friends and chronicling attempts to induce them to testify. One file listed a denunciation of him by a schoolteacher with whom he had mutual friends, he said. His dossier had been among ''thousands'' filling a bunker from floor to ceiling in the security-police headquarters in his hometown. His associates, who brought the documents to Bucharest and who asked not to be identified, said the files, discovered around 3 A.M. on Dec. 23, seemed to cover many of the adults among the Focsani area's population of about 100,000. Applied for Emigration Mr. Pavaloiae said he suspected that his friends had denounced him and had sensed that he was under surveillance, adding, ''But I could not imagine it was really happening.'' Eight months ago, Mr. Pavaloiae said, after he remarried -to a second wife of Jewish descent after a divorce from his first wife - he made a formal application to the authorities to emigrate to Israel along with their 5-month-old son, thinking to take advantage of Mr. Ceausescu's permissive policy toward Jewish immigration. It was not known tonight what the result of that application had been. But he said his story was not over. He had taken his personal files home from security-police headquarters to study them. Then came a knock on his door. Army officers, he said, had come to demand the return of the documents Sunday, and his fear of the authorities had revived. ''I was very scared,'' he said. ''I want to give my name to American journalists in case something happens to me.''\n",
            "doc 76: COMPUTER users rarely give much thought to their keyboards, yet they spend far more time in contact with the keys than with any other peripheral, with the possible exception of time spent making eye contact with the monitor. For many people, the fingers learn their working environment outside the consciousness of the brain. We could not draw an accurate layout of our keyboard from memory, for example, but if the Enter key were moved a quarter inch in any direction we would feel it instantly. That explains why some computer users react so strongly when someone suggests changing keyboards. The typist who has gone for months without thinking about such things is instantly aware that the new keyboard's keys are in the ''wrong'' place and that the keys have an alien feel, perhaps too hard or too mushy. Unfortunately, the keyboard is often the first place that computer companies turn when they try to save a dollar or two. Quality often suffers. Many users have no experience with superior keyboards and therefore never know what they are missing. Others, who do know what they are missing, look for a replacement keyboard, which typically costs $75 to $200. When it comes to replacement keyboards, forget the technical specifications. The subjective values of feel and key placement usually outweigh the purely technical variables, like the number of keys and the type of switching device, the mechanism that registers a keystroke electronically. And as with any subjective area, whether it is in film reviews or politics, what one person likes, another may hate. We recently got our fingers on an Omnikey Plus, a $119 replacement keyboard for I.B.M. PC, PS/2 and compatible computers, from Northgate Computer Systems Inc. of Plymouth, Minn. We like it a great deal, especially its lively, bouncy feel, its audible click and the placement of the function keys on the left side of the board, instead of along the top. Of course, not everyone views those attributes as positive. We have a colleague who contends he would rather drag his fingernails down a blackboard and plunge his fingers into a bowl of live crickets rather than type on the lively, noisy Omnikey Plus. (His keyboard, in turn, has a feel that we can only describe as crusted mush atop a broken tambourine. Keyboards evoke powerful sentiments.) Anyway, we have replaced the mushy keyboard that came with our Texas-made clone with the crisp Omnikey Plus. The Omnikey Plus has the full complement of Esc, NumLock, Ctrl, Alt, Del and other oddly labeled keys found on most PC keyboards, and it has a big, fat Enter key shaped like a reverse L, which helps those of us whose pinkies are somewhat uncoordinated. There is a separate numeric keypad, which is important if one spends a lot of time working with spreadsheets or financial software. In fact, the Omnikey Plus has just about every kind of key a normal computer user could want, plus some. For example, we still haven't figured out what the key labeled OMNI does; we asked Northgate's chief executive officer, who confessed that he was stumped by it too. Since nobody seems to know what to do with it, we have painted it red and re-labeled it PANIC, and it seems to work just fine. We use it often. We also find the Omnikey Plus's function keys easy to use. When the International Business Machines Corporation first introduced the PC, the keyboard was essentially the same as the one on the I.B.M. Selectric typewriter, with the addition of a bank of function keys on the left. Function keys are, as the name implies, intended for special functions. For example, the F1 key usually summons help. In the software we are using now, for example, the F5 key instantly sends the cursor to the command line at the top of the screen. There used to be 10 function keys on the left, arranged in two vertical columns of five each, but now we may find as many as 15 strung in a line along the top. Well, we hate that. Function keys belong on the left, and the Omnikey Plus puts them back in their proper place. Actually, the first 10 F keys are in their natural position, with F11 and F12 above them slightly, and F13, F14 and F15 way off to the upper right. Speaking of F13, it is a special key on the Omnikey Plus that as far as we know is used only by computer columnists who have to type ''I.B.M.'' Pressing F13 causes the ''period'' key to produce a period in both upper and lower (shifted and unshifted) cases. Before Northgate invented the key, the shifted period key produced a ''greater than'' symbol, which we use about once every leap year, except accidentally. The Omnikey Plus comes with two cords; one connects to conventional I.B.M. PC's, and the other to PS/2's, which have a different type of connector. The cords are long enough to work with desktop systems, but just barely. The Omnikey Plus, which can be ordered by calling (800) 526-2446, comes with a 10-day, no-questions-asked, money-back guarantee and a three-year unconditional warranty. Be sure to mention your brand and model of computer when ordering.\n",
            "doc 77: Journalists at The Jerusalem Post, Israel's only English-language newspaper, have mounted a drive to oust the paper's publisher of eight months, saying he is trying to turn the liberal daily into a platform for right-wing views. The Post's editor, Erwin Frenkel, resigned last Tuesday after the publisher, Yehuda Levy, a retired army colonel with no background in journalism, indicated that he had decided to take editorial control of the paper. The next day, The Post's news staff voted unanimously to call a strike in January. [Nine senior members of The Post's editorial staff, including the managing editor, David Landau, announced on Monday that they would resign in 30 days unless the publisher was replaced and Mr. Frenkel reinstated.]  Advocates Land for Peace The Jerusalem Post has a circulation of 25,000 on weekdays and 55,000 for its Friday weekend paper, and a circulation of 70,000 for its international weekly edition. It openly advocates territorial compromise with Israel's Arab enemies and has frequently published editorials criticizing the Government's handling of the two-year Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories. While most of Israel's mass-circulation dailies are liberal in tone, The Post is generally more to the left than many of the others. The Post is widely read by diplomats, tourists, journalists and Jews abroad, giving it a degree of importance in portraying Israel to the world that might seem disproportionate to its readership. Mr. Frenkel's resignation and the staff decision to call a strike has generated a furor here, forcing Mr. Levy to deny that he intends to change the paper's editorial slant. Calls Accusers 'Incorrect' ''Whoever is trying to make me look like someone trying to change the paper from left to right is just incorrect, although even this could be within my full right,'' Mr. Levy told the Israeli radio. He declined to be interviewed for this article. But in earlier interviews, Mr. Levy said he simply wanted The Post to be more balanced in its coverage. Post editors insist that Mr. Levy's growing involvement in the paper's daily report points to something else entirely, although they cannot produce a wealth of evidence to substantiate their criticism. Still, they complain that Mr. Levy recently urged the paper to write about the ''Jordan is Palestine'' crusade, a movement championed by right-wing academics and politicians who believe that a Palestinian state already exists in Jordan. They also say he went over the heads of editors to reprimand reporters covering politics and the occupied territories for what he saw as dovish articles, and has said in interviews that the paper should adopt a more pro-Zionist position. An Editorial Is Quashed Uncertainty over Mr. Levy's intentions peaked in November, when the publisher ordered Mr. Frenkel to withdraw an editorial from the paper's international edition. The editorial, which appeared in the daily, was a reply to criticism from Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who said The Post's left-wing editorial line undermined ''Israel's position'' in the Jewish world. In his editorial, Mr. Frenkel boasted that the paper ''consistently dissented from the Likud's territorialism,'' referring to the refusal by Mr. Shamir's party to cede land for peace. Mr. Frenkel also said The Post was not ''enraptured in its reporting of events by the Prime Minister's reading of Israel's international positions.'' The dispute over the editorial so angered Post editors that they now say they are unwilling to compromise with Mr. Levy. Mr. Landau, the managing editor, said ''his action regarding the editorial, which laid down the basic credo of The Jerusalem Post, still resonates.'' Other Post staff members asserted that officials in the Prime Minister's office persuaded Mr. Levy to pull the editorial. 'Address for the Pressure' ''The Prime Minister's and the Foreign Minister's offices maintain constant pressure on The Post, but until now they did not have an address for the pressure,'' Menachem Shalev, the paper's diplomatic correspondent, said last week. ''Now they do,'' He said Government officials have told him that Mr. Levy has assured them that the paper's editorial line will change. Mr. Levy will have the power to effect that change if he does take over as ''responsible editor'' of The Post, an intention he indicated in a letter written in early December to a committee of Israeli newspaper editors. Requesting admittance to the group, Mr. Levy wrote, ''As publisher, I intend to become very involved in the work of the editorial staff, and all that this implies.'' The letter prompted Mr. Frenkel's resignation. On Friday, Post employees rejected the idea that an interim editor take over until tempers cool, and they delivered an ultimatum to David Radler, the president of Hollinger Inc., a Canadian newspaper chain that owns the daily. Hollinger, which bought The Post in April, pledged at the time to preserve the paper's editorial independence. Mood Is 'Militant' ''I attempted to explain to him what his choices were, that the whole editoral staff speaks with one voice, and he has to choose between a good paper and sticking behind the man he appointed publisher,'' said Joanna Yehiel, The Post's magazine editor. She said Mr. Radler came to ''no conclusions, but he certainly listened.'' Other staff members were more blunt. ''We're trying to drive a wedge between Radler and Levy,'' a reporter said. ''They haven't lived up to their commitment, and that's what has turned the mood so militant.'' At the time of the sale, Post employees were ecstatic to learn that their paper was being bought by Hollinger, which owns about 200 papers across Canada, as well as the recently acquired Daily Telegraph of London. The Post had been on the market for several weeks, and its owner, the ailing Koor Industries, was determined to sell to the highest bidder. Absentee Ownership Koor, which is a part of the Histadrut trade union, led by the Labor Party, had essentially ignored The Post for years, insuring complete editorial independence. Potential buyers who vied for the daily included an Israeli businessman with close ties to the hawkish Minister of Trade, Ariel Sharon, and Robert Maxwell, the British publisher. The Post's editors feared that those buyers would alter the paper's dovish positions, and they were relieved when Koor accepted an 11th-hour offer of $17.5 million from the Hollinger group. The Hollinger bid was much higher than the paper's estimated worth, which Israeli newspaper executives put at about $3 million. But the relief was short-lived. Although Hollinger newspapers are not known for a strong stance on Israel, Mr. Radler took a greater interest in the country after striking up a friendship with Mr. Levy during Mr. Levy's time in Canada as emissary for the Jewish National Fund. Mr. Radler decided to buy The Post at Mr. Levy's suggestion. Immediately after the purchase, Mr. Levy was appointed publisher, and in an interview with another Israeli paper, he hinted that like the suitors the editors sought to avoid, he intended to transform The Post. 'Something of a Delusion' ''Altogether, it seems to me that in this matter of editorial independence there is something of a delusion,'' Mr. Levy said in the interview, held in July. ''If my editor takes a line which is not balanced, I think that it is my right and my duty to straighten him out.'' In the interview, Mr. Levy recalled serving as a military liaison for the foreign press during Israel's invasion of Lebanon. He said coverage of the Sabra and Shatila massacres was distorted because the press failed to mention that ''the number of civilians killed there didn't even reach 40.'' It is this portrait of Mr. Levy that alarms Post editors now. ''Imagine Sabra and Shatila happening today, and we're not allowed to report it,'' Mrs. Yehiel said last week. ''Is that what they want of The Jerusalem Post? Is that what the Jewish people want?''\n",
            "doc 78: About 10,000 people staged a noisy but peaceful demonstration today in support of democracy in China. The rally took place outside the offices of the official Chinese press agency, Beijing's quasi-official representative in this British colony. Demonstrators shouted slogans and carried banners that said, ''We Love China, Not Communism'' and ''Today Rumania, Tomorrow China.'' They also voiced support for the overthrow of Communist governments in Eastern Europe. The protesters earlier rallied in downtown Hong Kong before marching the several miles to the office of the New China News Agency. The demonstration was organized by the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the Patriotic Movement in China, which has been accused by Beijing of trying to use the British colony as a base for subversion in China. China has pledged to retain Hong Kong's capitalist and legal systems for 50 years after the territory reverts to Chinese rule in 1997.\n",
            "doc 79: For years Wall Street has been a beacon of wealth and glamour for talented young people willing to work punishing hours for mind-boggling pay. Today, as Wall Street shrinks back to life-size proportions, the game has shifted to making a living, not a killing. In the process, the flamboyant and extravagant lives captured in best sellers like Tom Wolfe's ''Bonfire of the Vanities'' and Michael Lewis's ''Liar's Poker'' are being replaced by a more subdued, sober culture. The ''Masters of the Universe,'' as Mr. Wolfe dubbed Wall Street's young deal makers, are finally being tamed. As layoffs and lower incomes take their psychological toll, and investment bankers realize their M.B.A.'s and Hermes ties no longer guarantee them a bright future, a new Wall Street persona is emerging. The Wall Street character of the 90's is likely to be humbler, more serious and conservative, less given to flights of fancy or self-promotion. Dwindling Year-End Bonuses The atmosphere is already changing. Young dealers no longer linger after work in comradely fashion but rush to the safety of their homes. Traders complain about working amid a sea of empty desks. Year-end bonuses provided the latest blow to self-esteem: Many found their pay packets reduced by 30 percent or more. ''There's a fair degree of paranoia,'' said Patrick J. Dunlavy, a managing director at Salomon Brothers, who said he is often approached by younger employees seeking reassurance. ''I think it's had a profound effect. You can see it in real estate, cars, vacations; everybody's a little more conservative about how they approach their life.'' It is the layoffs in particular that have imposed the greatest emotional strain, driving a wedge between those who are still employed and their friends who were dismissed but have yet to find new jobs. One bond salesman in a regional office sat and watched as the number of his fellow workers shrank from 15 to 4. ''People are incredibly depressed,'' one investment banker in his mid-30's said. ''Everybody is talking about people who've been let go and wondering whether they're next.'' Not Much Sympathy That Wall Streeters would finally get their comeuppance seems only just to many onlookers. Few harbor great sympathy for those who earned half a million dollars or more a year, and spent it. And even now, after the steep pay cuts, they still earn more than most families. On the other hand, the loss of job and income can be as psychologically wrenching for wealthy investment bankers as it is for steelworkers. The adjustment for refugees from Wall Street is conceivably even more difficult because of the heights from which they fell. Many grew up, after all, in the boom years of the mid-1980's, when the stock market was soaring and takeovers generated billions of dollars in fees. Wall Street firms were expanding their work forces by 20 percent or more a year and throwing money at anything that moved. Those who got pulled into that whirlwind found they could do no wrong. The sudden rush of wealth and status that resulted was perhaps best captured in the movie ''Wall Street,'' with Charlie Sheen and Daryl Hannah gliding around the high-tech kitchen of their newly decorated penthouse, sipping white wine and making fresh pasta and sushi to the tune of the Talking Heads. 'It's Too Perfect' Seated at their dining room table afterward, staring at the wonders they had wrought, Mr. Sheen whispers: ''It's too perfect. Let's not even eat. Let's just watch it, think about it.'' His comment seemed aimed more at life than at sushi. Although Mr. Sheen's character ''made it'' with the help of a little insider trading, Wall Street several years ago was generous to almost anyone. Looking back on it, investment bankers say that for many it was a case of being in the right place at the right time. ''All many people needed to do was be reasonably well dressed, with a clean, well-scrubbed face, and know how to use a PC,'' said Stephen A. Schwarzman, president of the Blackstone Group, a New York investment firm, who considers himself an old-timer. ''The era made mediocrities look like geniuses. Now you actually have to do something to make money, as opposed to just being alive.'' Investment bankers of the future, Wall Street executives say, will work harder and keep their heads down. They will complain less often about higher pay at other firms, like Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., and brag less vociferously about their multimillion-dollar condos. 'Different Style' Is Coming ''For those who remain, there will probably be a different style,'' predicted Paul K. Kelly, president of Peers & Company, a New York investment firm. ''This self-promotional, P.R. type is probably gone.'' Recruiters at several Wall Street firms said that new candidates coming out of business school will reinforce this trend, for they are a different breed altogether. In the mid-1980's, the recruiters said those who made a beeline for Wall Street were often brash, quick-buck artists. ''They went into investment banking for all the wrong reasons: glamour, money, a lot of superficial reasons,'' one recruiter observed. Those who choose the securities industry today are more likely to be interested in the field of finance and relish the challenges of that business. Wall Street is now attracting ''those who are less flamboyant, less interested in a short-term payoff,'' said Samuel L. Hayes 3d, a Harvard Business School professor who specializes in investment banking. ''They tend to take a longer-term view of their career, and they have a compelling interest in the work.'' In 1986, Fortune magazine ran a photograph on its cover of a young investment banker at Kidder, Peabody & Company who seemed to embody all the excess of the decade. He sported an enormous cigar and a cocksure look, and the caption gave only the relevant details: his age, 31, and his salary, around $500,000. 'More Sober, Less Colorful' Asked to imagine what a similar cover photo would look like several years hence, Ali E. Wambold, a partner at Lazard Freres & Company, predicted that he would have gray hair. (The gender was taken for granted.) ''Not all gray,'' Mr. Wambold said. ''Salt and pepper. He'll be more sober, less colorful. He's kind of like a guy from Deutsche Bank.'' And, miracle of miracles, he will be quieter. ''He'll have learned that the limelight is dangerous,'' Mr. Wambold said. That is already somewhat in evidence at Wasserstein, Perella & Company, a go-go mergers firm. The normally voluble Bruce Wasserstein no longer returns press calls freely but refers them to other executives or a more reticent public relations firm. And there are other signs of the new toned-down investment banker. An executive at Barney's, the fashionable department store, reports that many of his Wall Street customers are shedding their impulsive ways. Where a swashbuckling young investment banker used to buy three or four $700 suits and then spring for that special, $1,200 outfit that caught his eye, he will now skip the treat. ''People are watching price a lot more closely,'' said Frank E. Ball, a senior vice president. ''They're a little more conscious of what they're doing.'' Fewer Fancy Dinner Parties Geraldo Bruno, one of the owners of Sistina, a trendy Italian restaurant on Manhattan's Upper East Side, said he has also seen a change in attitude. Many of his younger Wall Street customers have departed for other cities. Those who remain no longer give such extravagant dinner parties. ''They all look at how much they're spending, and they don't invite as large a group,'' he said. The real estate market also shows signs of a more conservative financial approach. Brokers speak of investment bankers who were considering buying homes out of the city, but decided to stay in town instead and continue renting. And they say the luxury end of the real estate market is holding firm in Manhattan but is being trounced in the suburbs. Executives with growing families are still buying apartments with more bedrooms. But Stuart N. Siegel, a senior vice president at Sotheby's International Realty, said: ''People are not trading up for the sake of trading up. It was like a big race before.'' Real estate, of course, was one of the litmus tests of wealth and status, so a pullback there feeds into the general mood on Wall Street. ''They used to brag about the value of their condo or their summer home,'' Mr. Dunlavy of Salomon said. ''You don't hear those conversations anymore. I hear a lot more people worried about their mortgage payments.'' Some Have Nice Nest Egg Times are not bleak everywhere. Certain firms, like Dillon Read, Lazard Freres and Bear, Stearns, are weathering the storm well and have not had to impose mass layoffs. And many of the ''older'' investment bankers, in their mid-40's, have amassed a nice nest egg. They used the gusher of the mid-1980's to buy a comfortable house, several cars and maybe even a summer home. With many large purchases behind them, some were even able to tuck away a little for a rainy day. Those in their 50's, in turn, may simply retire from the industry and dabble in investing or deal making from the comfort of their living room. And, of course, certain types of people can never be beaten down. Mr. Wambold, a self-confessed investment-banking brat, who joined the profession in 1981, said the best people have always been nervous about what to do for an encore, and so they have been pushing all along to uncover the industry's next frontier. ''It's like Tarzan swinging from one vine to the next,'' he said. ''We're all confident we can find the next vine.''\n",
            "doc 80: President Vaclav Havel told the citizens of Czechoslovakia today that their Communist leaders had lied to them for 40 years, that their country was in a serious economic and environmental crisis, and that only a return to the values of honesty, decency and mutual respect could lead to recovery. ''For 40 years you have heard on this day from the mouths of my predecessors, in a number of variations, the same thing: how our country is flourishing, how many more millions of tons of steel we have produced, how we are all happy, how we believe in our Government,'' the author and playwright began, wearing glasses and reading from a manuscript. ''I assume you have not named me to this office so that I, too, should lie to you. ''We have become morally ill because we are used to saying one thing and thinking another,'' Mr. Havel said. His televised message seemed to be aimed at sobering a people who spent the New Year's holiday in delirious celebration of his election and the new freedom that it symbolized. [Excerpts from Mr. Havel's speech appear on page A13.]  A Sadness 'Inflicted on Ourselves' But in an allusion to widespread Czechoslovak resentment of the Soviet Union, he said, ''It would be very unwise to think of the sad heritage of the last 40 years only as something foreign, something inherited from a distant relative.'' On the contrary, he said, ''it is ''something we have inflicted on ourselves.'' Mr. Havel, who was elected by the national Parliament on Friday, repeatedly called in his 40-minute address for mutual respect among the Czechs, Slovaks, and other nationalities in this Central European country, without directly comparing ethnic tensions with similar problems in the Soviet Union. He announced an amnesty for thousands of prisoners who have been protesting overcrowded conditions, poor food, and the lack of rehabilitation in more than a score of jails across the country. He also called for trials to assess responsibility for the Stalinist style of repression in Czechoslovakia over the past 40 years; said he hoped that diplomatic relations could soon be restored with the Vatican and Israel; and invited Pope John Paul II and the Dalai Lama, the winner of last year's Nobel Peace Prize, to visit Czechoslovakia. Amnesty for Lighter Offenses Mr. Havel is to visit East Germany and West Germany on Tuesday. ''I want to contribute to the cause of peace,'' he said, ''by my short visit tomorrow to our two mutually related neighbors: the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.'' ''I have decided to proclaim a relatively broad amnesty,'' he said of the prison inmates, ''but I appeal to the prisoners to understand that 40 years of degraded justice cannot be done away with all at once. By uprisings they will help neither the republic nor themselves.'' He urged Czechoslovak citizens ''not to be afraid of released prisoners, but to help them in a Christian spirit after their return among us, to find in themselves what our prisons could not instill: repentance and a desire to lead a good life.'' Officials said later that the amnesty would free all prisoners serving sentences of two years or less and reduce longer terms by as much as one half. It would not affect people convicted of terrorism, murder, robbery, rape or other sexual abuse, or misuse of public office. The country's jails hold about 50,000 people. Ex-Party Chief in Custody The highest-ranking Czechoslovak official known to have been taken into custody on charges of abusing his office is Miroslav Stepan, who was the head of Prague's Communist Party organization when the police in the capital moved in to repress demonstrations on Nov. 17. He was arrested on Dec. 23, the Government press agency said. Mr. Havel also replaced the Prosecutor General and the Interior Minister today, continuing a shake-up in response to the Nov. 17 crackdown. In a series of prison terms beginning in 1977, Mr. Havel served more than five years for refusing to surrender his conscience to the dictates of the Communist state. He told his listeners today that he would be ''a President that would speak less but work harder, who will be permanently present among his fellow citizens and listen to them well.'' He said that the most difficult work, of insuring that freedom will last, was only beginning, like the cleanup of champagne bottles and broken streamers from Wenceslas Square, Prague's main gathering place. From Revelry to Reflection The cobblestones were literally wet with champagne Sunday night as tens of thousands of people came out to celebrate the New Year with whatever beverage came to hand, often sparkling wine made in the Soviet Union. Friends and lovers embraced on the square, firecrackers exploded in salutes and the crowd burst into song, marking the end of a year that also brought new freedom to Poland, Hungary, East Germany and Rumania. ''You have had freedom always,'' said a gray-haired man, Jaroslav Baraban, amid the din, ''but we have only known it for a month.'' Like many who filled the vast square, half a mile long and 200 feet wide, between midnight and dawn this morning, the man was nearly weeping. He joined in the repeated chants of ''Havel, Havel,'' ''Long Live Havel'' that demonstrate how much of a symbol the new President has become. The celebrations turned more solemn and dignified today as church bells pealed from the medieval towers and baroque domes of the golden city. The gilded baroque interior of the Church of St. James filled with worshipers who flocked to hear a high mass and a performance of Mozart's Coronation Mass by a choir and orchestra. Tonight Mr. Havel and his wife attended a concert of Dvorak's Slavonic Dances in the Municipal Building, where the independence of Czechoslovakia was first proclaimed in 1918. A Farewell to Cynicism ''Everywhere in the world,'' Mr. Havel told the nation in his address this afternoon, ''people were surprised at how these malleable, humiliated, cynical citizens of Czechoslovakia, who seemingly believed in nothing, found the tremendous strength to cast off the totalitarian system in an entirely peaceful and dignified manner within a few weeks. ''Humanistic and democratic tradition slept on after all somewhere in the unconscious of our nation and national minorities,'' he said. But Czechoslovakia also owed its freedom, Mr. Havel said, ''to the courage of those in the Soviet Union, East Germany, Hungary and Poland who had fought for theirs.'' ''All human suffering concerns each human being,'' he said. He acknowledged that without recent political changes in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia's revolution would have suffered the same fate as the Prague Spring of 1968, the reform movement that was cut short by a Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion. Mr. Havel ended his speech with a double echo of Czechoslovak history. He recalled that Thomas G. Masaryk, Czechoslovakia's first President, had taken a prayer by the 17th century Moravian churchman, John Amos Comenius, and paraphrased it: ''Your Government, my people, has returned to you.'' The crowd in Wenceslas Square last night also echoed Comenius, breaking into a song made popular by the artist Marta Kubicova during the brief Prague Spring. ''May peace be with this land,'' they sang. ''Let hate, envy, fear and conflict pass. May they pass, may they pass.''\n",
            "doc 81: With economic conditions becoming more treacherous and takeovers less trendy, the companies that simply did what they said they were going to do walked away last year as the big winners on the American Stock Exchange. Included on the list of top percentage gainers were some companies whose distinction appears to be that their earnings have improved nicely, like Old Spaghetti Warehouse Inc., a small but growing chain of restaurants, and Keane Inc., a Boston-based purveyor of computer software. Over all, the Amex market-value index hit an all-time high of 397.03 on Oct. 10, and closed the year at 378, up by 23.5 percent. That fell short of the 24.8 percent advance by the New York Stock Exchange composite index, and the 27 percent climb by the Dow Jones industrial average. But the Amex gain exceeded the 19.3 percent rise by the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter issues. In 1988, the Amex's index outperformed the other gauges, posting a 17.5 percent annual rise. Aided by Oil and Gas With a heavy concentration of smaller listings, the Amex might have trailed the 1989 pack by a wider margin were it not for its unusual number of oil and gas listings, said William M. LeFevre, the market strategist for Advest Inc. The sector enjoyed a good fourth quarter because of rising oil prices and the cold weather. Volume on the Amex rose by 24.3 percent over the 1988 levels, to 3.1 billion shares, for a daily average of 12.4 million shares. That was short of the exchange's all-time high in 1987, when 3.5 billion shares changed hands. The Amex's worst performers had more than their share of headaches. Manufactured Homes Inc., a retailer of mobile homes whose shares tumbled from $6.25 to 56 cents through the year, said it was having severe cash flow problems because of insufficient financing for its retail customers, and its auditors questioned whether it could survive as a going concern. The company declined to comment. Centrust Spending Criticized Centrust Savings Bank, the next worst performer, saw its once high-flying stock fall to 56 cents, from $5.75, by the year's end. The Florida-based institution has been sparring with industry regulators over criticism that it spent lavishly on art and other management perquisites despite heavy operating losses. Enviropact Inc., a provider of environmental services, was unable to pay a tax bill, prompting its auditors to question the company's ability to survive as a going concern. Lawrence Turner, an outside director, said the company had since sold a division to pay the tax but must live with the stigma until its next audit. ''Unfortunately, there's no process for getting that relieved,'' he added. Finally, political events abroad appeared to have both helped and hurt. For instance, the stock of the Compudyne Corporation, a maker of military electronic equipment, dropped by 72 percent over the year because of losses on fixed-price development contracts, a problem the company believes will be overcome in 1990. But fears that military spending may be one casualty of peace has not helped Compudyne woo investors. ''It's not going to be high on a list of buys,'' said Stephen Henn, the company's treasurer. On the other hand, the Stevens Graphics Corporation, a maker of printing presses, may have benefited when it landed some contracts in the Soviet Union, cracking what is expected to be a blossoming market for Western goods in that country.\n",

Flight 240, with 247 passengers and 10 crew members, was bound from the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport to LaGuardia Airport when the plane landed at 12:02 A.M., the spokeswoman, Susan R.

            "doc 83: GOOD Housekeeping, the magazine that declared that the liberated woman had been succeeded by the ''new traditionalist,'' is risking another look into the future, contending that the 1990's will be the ''decency decade.'' In an old-fashioned all-text advertisement that starts running today in several magazines and newspapers and contains the familiar Good Housekeeping ''seal of approval,'' the venerable women's magazine maintains that in the 90's goodness will reign for the earth, the family, corporate ethics and consumers as new traditionalists ''lead an unstoppable environmental juggernaut'' and ''look for what is real, what is honest, what is quality, what is valued, what is important.'' Good Housekeeping's original ''new traditionalist'' campaign, by the ad agency Jordan, McGrath, Case & Taylor, attracted inordinate attention, both for dramatic black-and-white portraits of women by Mary Ellen Mark and for the boldness of the pronouncement that women were returning to hearth and home. To many, the assertions flew in the face of reality. For example, last year, more than half the mothers with children under a year old were working, for the first time in the nation's history. A New York Times poll of 1,025 women, conducted in June, showed that 56 percent of the women believed American society had not changed enough to allow women to compete with men on an equal basis. The poll also showed serious concerns among women about their ability to combine jobs and family life. Some people, and even some other women's magazines, attacked Good Housekeeping. ''A lot was a misunderstanding,'' said Alan M. Waxenberg, the magazine's publisher. ''The ads were taken as meaning that women were leaving the work force. That's not what they meant. It was a philosophy.'' Malcolm MacDougall, vice chairman of Jordan, McGrath, said: ''We were celebrating working mothers. All but two of the women we used in the ads were working mothers.'' The new ''decency decade'' campaign not only celebrates the working mother but extols what the magazine says is a new attitude that will force manufacturers to mend their ways. In a presentation Good Housekeeping is taking to 16 cities over the next four months, the magazine makes several claims, among them that the new traditionalist ''can make or break brands,'' ''has become aware of the connections between the products she purchases and their social consequences'' and ''will reject mindless line extensions and over-manipulative marketing.'' The support for these conclusions comes not from rigorous survey data but from focus groups and in-depth interviews with consumers and experts conducted by Faith Popcorn. A familiar Madison Avenue figure and well-known pop sociologist, Ms. Popcorn heads Brainreserve, an oft-quoted trend-analysis organization. She responded to a question about the pitfalls of projecting future social trends from current trends by saying: ''These are spiritual trends. The 80's was a glitz blitz. That will be an embarrassing place for companies to be in the 90's. We see companies making responsible decisions for society.'' Behind Good Housekeeping's new ad campaign lies a desire to reinvigorate its ''seal of approval,'' which turns 80 years old this year. Part of the magazine's presentation to advertisers includes the result of a survey of 800 consumers who were asked, with no prompting, to name stamps, endorsements and seals on products. The Good Housekeeping seal finished first, named by 30.3 percent of those surveyed. The United States Department of Agriculture stamp was second, cited by 20.8 percent. The magazine hopes that advertisers who accept its conclusions about the ''decency decade'' will see the seal - which is bestowed only on Good Housekeeping advertisers - as a symbol of the manufacturer's concern for the new traditionalist's public-spiritedness.\n",
            "doc 84: At one of Beijing's elite universities not long ago, students were subjected to another of a series of propaganda films intended to insure the reindoctrination of China's future leaders along the correct Communist road. These same students had led ''the counterrevolutionary rebellion'' crushed so brutally in June, and they have since been subjected to steady, numbing sessions of political education. The film that evening, ''Wei Wei Kunlun,'' which translates roughly as ''Towering Mountain,'' depicted China before the Communist takeover in 1949. A scene of a demonstration being violently broken up brought cheers because unlike the case in June no tanks were used. Party officials asked the students why they had applauded. ''Because it was such a good film,'' they said. Common on the Campuses Stories of quiet mockery of this sort are common on the campuses. The familiar slogan ''Only socialism can save China'' has been slightly altered to become, ''Only without socialism can China be saved.'' Freshmen at Beijing University have been sent off to Hebei Province for military and political training for a year; older students say that when the freshmen return they will practice ''peaceful evolution'' on them -the party catch phrase for the supposed capitalist strategy to undermine Chinese Communism through the introduction of alien cultural influences. One upperclassman, a party member, said, ''We will pass on to them their proper education in the four evils'' - excessive eating, drinking, gambling and promiscuity - and he seemed to be quite serious about the task. The rapid changes in Eastern Europe, and especially the overthrow and execution of Nicolae Ceausescu, the Rumanian leader who was a longtime ally of the Chinese leadership, have brought a few daring gatherings and posters. Like the mockery, they are indicative of a lasting disgust and a resoluteness of spirit largely untouched by the ideological corset being tightened everywhere in intellectual and academic life. But while the investigations are winding down and students and teachers await the party's judgments on punishment, there is wariness and mistrust everywhere and a general depression about the future that argues against any rapid re-emergence of the sort of demonstrations that electrified the world last spring. A Sense of Caution The unexpected death of a prominent figure like Deng Xiaoping or Zhao Ziyang, the party leader who lost his job after showing some sympathy with the June demonstrations, could create a pretext for students to gather and march, but few believe the leadership would react a second time with so much confusion and delay. Students and teachers interviewed over the last three weeks described caution and lack of purpose. Among many students there is a self-imposed cap on political discussion and an aimless escapism. There are increasing experiments in casual sex and alcohol abuse. ''We're watching trashy movies and reading trashy novels,'' one student said. ''Sidney Sheldon is very popular now, and so is 'I'll Take Manhattan.' '' Students speak of a sense of isolation from the larger society. ''The campus is a very small world,'' one said. ''It's like living in a cage, and you feel watched all the time.'' People are ''depressed and discouraged,'' she said. ''Life seems meaningless now, and they are cynical. They feel bored. Life is boring if you're in school or out, boring if you have a boyfriend or not, boring if you work or not.'' Students still speak of politics to their closest friends, ''but that gets boring, too,'' the student said. ''We don't disagree about anything. We all want change. But politics once again seems like empty talk.'' Something to Hide The analogy of Rumania frightens the Government right now, another student said. ''All the killing frightens us, too. We don't think the Chinese Army will crack so quickly as in Rumania, and many more could die.'' Most students, one said, had made less than fully forthcoming self-criticisms and protected their friends, and there is a feeling that many teachers and deans are also protecting students from the authorities. ''But there are a lot of people who participated and have something to hide,'' he said. ''So people don't trust one another. It is one of the biggest successes of the Government.'' Some students said many wanted either to go abroad or to make a lot of money and live an easy life. Everyone seems to be learning English and trying to pass the language examinations required to study abroad. But freshman are now judged too young to study abroad, and graduating students are told they must stay in China and work off their debt to society. ''It's a way of keeping people here,'' a teacher said. Teachers describe relatively open political discussion in the faculty rooms, but they are under strict orders not to discuss politics in class or with students. ''The party tells us, 'If you have your own views, O.K., but don't pollute them,' '' a teacher said. Another described a faculty meeting with the party secretary, who complained that while some students had informed on others, no teachers had done so, behavior that set a bad example. The party secretary was particularly outraged because he had received anonymous letters purporting to inform on him. ''We felt he had no sense of shame,'' the teacher said. ''Only the die-hard leftists or the careerists pursue this witch hunt.'' Caution Is Still Needed One must nonetheless be careful, another teacher said. She was teaching a night class in English to adults who were behaving passively while she was trying to explain the prefix ''octo.'' ''So I finally said: 'Why don't you talk? You're as stubborn as octogenarians!' ''The class laughed, but the next day she was called in by the party secretary and asked why she had made fun of the party leadership, which is largely composed of elderly officials. ''I said that it was in the textbook,'' she said, ''and that was that, but it worried me. Someone obviously made a report.'' Another teacher said that while he understood his students' anger and shared it, he tried to caution them that the situation could get worse, as it did in the 1950's and '60's. ''The students are impatient, of course, and want rapid change, and they have their own ideas. But I don't want them to get into trouble or waste their lives. We've all been inspired by a few demonstrations and by Rumania, but I tell them: 'Right now, your lives are more important. Don't throw them away.' ''\n",
            "doc 85: Matthew R. Starr washes pots and pans in the Marriott Hotel here. For $3.60 an hour, 40 hours a week, he presides over three arm-deep steel sinks, one for washing, one for a regular rinse and one for an extra sanitizing rinse. He cleans the pots with a dark green sponge. ''Sometimes I use a scrub brush,'' he said, ''but it doesn't do a good job. A sponge does a good job because it gets in the corners.'' Scouring the inside of a heavy aluminum pot, he explained: ''You do the bottom first. Then you do the sides and then the rim. Then you flip it over and do the same thing.'' It is routine and unremarkable work except that the person doing it has Down syndrome, a congenital mental deficiency. Mr. Starr has learned the washing process by rote. He does not discriminate particularly well among his pots, so he scrubs every one, even those that do not need it. ''It's a bit boring,'' he said. ''I've been doing pots and pans for a year now. Pots and pans every day. I want to move on.'' Real Jobs, Real Wages Mr. Starr is an amiable 22-year-old warrior in an unsung revolution in the workplace. He is in the vanguard among retarded people who have real jobs, paying real wages, receiving full benefits, working alongside people who are not disabled. He is uncommonly well equipped for work because of years of special attention, at home and at school. He fits into the category of the mildly retarded who make up 90 percent of all retarded people, according to the Association for Retarded Citizens of the United States in Arlington, Tex. Until a couple of years ago, few of the four million to five million retarded people could hope to get real jobs. Reliable nationwide figures for those who have found work lately are not available, but at least a few tens of thousands have, experts say. Hundreds of thousands more - including profoundly retarded people who do not read, write or sometimes even speak - could work, too, once more employers get over their qualms and more training systems are established. ''We've just got to look a little harder to find what they're good at,'' said David M. Mank, professor of special education and rehabilitation at the University of Oregon. ''The issue is not that these people can't work,'' said William E. Kiernan, director of the Training and Research Institute for Adults with Disabilities at Children's Hospital in Boston. ''The issue is that we haven't made the connections yet.' Marriott a Pace Setter In countless communities, public and private agencies, most less than five years old, have sprung up to accommodate the retarded. One, Transcen Inc. in Rockville, Md., discovered Mr. Starr for Marriott; another, the Young Adult Institute in New York, has placed hundreds in the offices of major corporations in the city. Experts call Marriott a pace setter; it has about 6,000 disabled employees, a large but untabulated number of them retarded. Other pace setters include the Pizza Hut and McDonald's restaurant chains, the Boeing Company, United Airlines and the International Business Machines Corporation; the jobs include pressing and folding linens in hotel laundries, filling fast-food boxes, cleaning tables and sweeping floors. Altruism has little to do with the hiring. The companies need the workers. They are competing in a tight labor market, and with the decline in the birthrate in the 1970's, they expect it to tighten still more through the next decade. Having tapped most other sources of workers, they are now tapping people who were once deemed unsuitable. Not every retarded recruit works out, any more than other people do, said Kathleen Alexander, vice president for personnel services at Marriott. ''But what we're learning is not to make distinctions,'' she added. ''It sounds Pollyanna-ish, but we're focusing on what's the job to be done and who can we get to do it.'' If Marriott needs someone to wash pots and pans, it looks for someone who can do the job or be trained to do it. Laura Davis, coordinator of the company's effort to hire retarded workers, said: ''Matthew happens to have Down syndrome. He also happens to be a good pot washer.'' Living With Down Syndrome Mr. Starr said having Down syndrome pained him when he was in school. ''Some people teased me a lot,'' he said. ''They said: 'Hey, retard. Hey, slugface.' I hated that. Now at my job they don't tease me because I'm able to do the job.' '' Having Down syndrome now, he said, ''is like being a normal kid, a normal adult.'' ''I have Down syndrome,'' he went on. ''Other people have learning disabilities. Everyone. Even my parents.'' His affliction aside, Mr. Starr is a blue-collar Everyman, with Everyman's foibles and fantasies. He watches television, likes James Bond movies and does his laundry and some cooking in a single-family house in nearby Rockville that he shares with five other retarded people and a resident counselor. In the hip pocket of his uniform this week, he had a copy of a Hardy Boys book, ''Death Game.'' ''I have a whole collection of these,'' he said. And on a personal computer in his room, he composes a speech on living with Down syndrome that he gives each fall to first-year medical students at the University of Maryland, where his father, Raymond Starr, is a professor of psychology. Like his nondisabled co-workers in the Marriott kitchen, he commutes to work, taking a 40-minute trip each way on two buses. He pays his $325-a-month rent with a check he writes himself, with prompting, on an account at a bank in his neighborhood where he deposits his paycheck each Friday. He has a card to a teller machine. His mother, Janice Starr, the director of a social service agency in Baltimore that finds financial aid for college students, said her son needs help buying clothes but rents videotapes, goes to movies and has his hair cut on his own. ''He doesn't know a great deal about the inherent concept of money,'' Mrs. Starr said. ''But he understands it as a mechanism of trade. He certainly wants to get lots of it.'' He dreams of becoming a movie star. He played the Tin Man in ''The Wizard of Oz'' once at summer camp. At Marriott, he said, he would welcome a job in management, so ''I could go around and ask people how they were doing.'' But he would settle for another raise -he has had one, of 25 cents an hour -and a promotion out of pots and pans. From Shelter to the Workplace Mr. Starr is the beneficiary of important changes in dealing with retarded people. For decades, in an approach that was thought generous and benevolent, people were tucked away in institutional homes and shuttled in groups to ''sheltered workshops.'' There, even now, many are paid a dollar an hour or so to sit together stuffing envelopes or putting caps on lipstick tubes. Attitudes began shifting in the 1970's with the efforts of parents and school systems to keep retarded children at home and train them to function in the real world. The principal approach today is called ''supported employment.'' It is assumed that the retarded need help managing the routines of living and working, so with job coaches at the workplace and counselors at home, such people can stay in the mainstream. Training and placement agencies and a few employers like Marriott deploy job coaches to supervise the employees' adjustment to the job. Mr. Starr needed about 10 weeks of close daily guidance, being drilled on his pot-washing routine. His coach, Laurie Patterson, oversees five other retarded workers in Marriott operations. She wears a beeper on which management or the employee himself can call her. ''Matthew is the only pot washer here,'' Ms. Patterson said. ''On a busy day he can get backed up with his pots, and he gets frustrated. He throws up his hands and says, 'I don't want to do this any more.' I come over and tell him, 'Matthew, you can't leave.' I will wash pots with him. Matthew will always need that kind of support.'' ''I get stressed out,'' Mr. Starr said. Other times, on lighter days, he will try to hurry through his pots and slip out without telling anyone. ''That's a bad habit of mine,'' he said. 'He's Part of the System' For governments as for employers, the new approach has immense appeal. In an era of tight budgets, public agencies have found themselves strapped by the cost of welfare payments and institutional care for the retarded. ''We're able to move people off the welfare rolls and give them meaningful jobs,'' said Joel M. Levy, executive director of the Young Adult Institute. ''More than that, we're able to move them from stagnation to a life of hope and productivity.'' Mrs. Starr said her son, unlike most in the generations of retarded people before him, was raised at home and took some regular classes in public schools along with his special classes. ''Matthew will probably be paying income taxes this year,'' Mrs. Starr said. ''He's not a burden to the system; he's part of the system.'' According to a survey by the Federal Government, retarded people in regular jobs are paid an average of $3.06 an hour, 29 cents below the minimum wage. The Government permits exceptions to the minimum wage in cases of people who cannot work as fast as others. ''But that's three times what they earned in sheltered workshops,'' said an Education Department specialist in employing disabled workers. Some advocates for retarded people, however, say a subminimum wage exploits the retarded workers. They say the retarded may work more slowly but are often better, more dependable employees than minimum-wage workers who are not disabled. Lower Turnover In a program subsidized by the Department of Education, Pizza Hut hired 1,012 disabled workers in 35 states in the 12 months ending in October. Seventy-three percent were mentally retarded. In a report on the program, the company said the workers stay four to five times longer than other employees. This means a substantial saving for the company, because recruiting, hiring and training a new worker costs $600 to $1,300. Overall, the lower turnover saved the company $2.2 million. With that in mind, said Steven Zivolich, director of the Pizza Hut program, ''we bring any of these people who are working at 75 percent of our typical productivity up to the minimum wage.'' Matthew Starr failed once. Before coming to Marriott, he delivered mail at the Department of Agriculture in Washington. There was no one to guide him after two or three days, and sometimes he found himself so backed up with mail that he threw it away. ''He lacks a capacity for independent judgment,'' said Margaret J. Leedy of Transcen, who brought Mr. Starr to Marriott and trained Ms. Patterson to coach him. ''His mail built up and built up,'' she said. ''It makes you look bad. So what do you do? You get rid of it.'' Mr. Starr, wincing at the memory, said, ''Let's just say there was not enough job coaching.'' Mr. Starr is now interviewing for a job in the mailroom of Marriott's headquarters in Bethesda, Md., with Ms. Patterson there to coach him. It means a promotion and a raise, and he seems likely to get them. For Marriott, Ms. Davis said, ''failure would be not promoting him.''\n",
            "doc 86: The Israeli Government remained in a deadlock today over Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's dismissal of the Labor Party's outspoken Cabinet Minister, Ezer Weizman, on Sunday. Neither the right-wing Likud party, headed by Mr. Shamir, nor the left-center Labor Party ruled out a compromise to save the shaky coalition Government they formed in November 1988 after indecisive elections. Both major parties are interested in keeping the coalition. Labor is simply trying to find a way to stay in the Government with Mr. Weizman reinstated, while Likud is trying to retain the current political arrangement and keep him out. Similar Dispute in '86 A similar dispute split a coalition Government in July 1986 when then-Prime Minister Shimon Peres, the Labor Party leader, forced Justice Minister Yitzhak Modai, a member of Likud, to resign after Mr. Modai sharp criticized Mr. Peres. After the Prime Minister's job was rotated three months later, with Mr. Shamir taking the helm, Mr. Modai was reinstated as a Minister Without Portfolio. Mr. Shamir charged Sunday that Mr. Weizman had met with representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organization, exchanged messages with the P.L.O. chairman, Yasir Arafat, and advised the P.L.O. to respond positively to a five-point peace plan being advanced by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. A Clear Stand Justice Minister Dan Meridor said today that if Mr. Shamir had not taken a clear stand on Mr. Weizman's activities, then ''all of us - the entire Government - could no longer claim that we weren't conducting negotiations with the P.L.O.'' Yossi Achimeir, a high-ranking aide in the Prime Minister's office, said today in a telephone interview that Mr. Shamir has a transcript of a conversation between Mr. Weizman and Nabil Ramlawi, the P.L.O. representative in Geneva, which supposedly took place in a hotel room in Geneva in June. Although he refused to provide any details of the conversation itself, he said the Israeli secret services had obtained the documents by trailing ''the enemy.'' Following the Enemy ''Our services don't follow our men but they do follow the enemy,'' Mr. Achimeir said. ''And by following the enemy, they saw this material, a transcript of the talks between the two men.'' In addition, he said, Mr. Shamir has documents that reveal a more recent role by Mr. Weizman in transferring messages to Mr. Arafat and receiving messages from him. He said he had no knowledge of any telephone taps being placed in Mr. Weizman's home or in the homes of of other Israeli Cabinet ministers. Mr. Weizman is supposed to have acted through Dr. Ahmed Tibi, an Israeli-Arab doctor who has been involved in prisoner-exchange negotiations between Israel and the P.L.O. Meeting Acknowledged Mr. Weizman, who acknowledged Sunday that he had met with Dr. Tibi, said today that he had received at least one phone call from a P.L.O. representative in Tunis, Israel radio reported. An advocate of direct talks with the P.L.O., Mr. Weizman is a former member of Menachem Begin's Likud bloc, having served as Mr. Begin's Defense Minister. He resigned that post when he believed that Mr. Begin had been stalling in talks with Egypt on Palestinian autonomy. Likud ministers close to Mr. Shamir were trying to persuade him today to meet with Mr. Weizman and show him the evidence against him. Mr. Achimeir said such a meeting is very likely on Tuesday before the 1 P.M. deadline when Mr. Weizman's termination becomes effective. Labor ministers unanimously backed Mr. Weizman and insisted that he be reinstated while at the same time criticizing any possible ties he might have had with the P.L.O. Protest Over Demonstration The ultra-Orthodox Agudat Israel party is scheduled to float a no-confidence vote in the Government on Tuesday because a license was issued for a large-scale Peace Now demonstration in Jerusalem on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath. The Labor Party is threatening to join the no-confidence vote if the Weizman affair is not resolved. In such an event, President Chaim Herzog would have to select either Mr. Shamir or Mr. Peres, the respective party leaders, to try to form a narrow coalition government. And, if neither leader succeeded, elections would follow. To resolve the crisis today, President Herzog suggested that Mr. Weizman be temporarily suspended from the Government while a judicial body investigates the charges against him. No one has yet to respond to the idea. ----P.L.O.'s Perspective BAGHDAD, Iraq, Jan. 1 (Reuters) -An adviser to Mr. Arafat said today that several Israeli ministers and senior officials had met with P.L.O. representatives. The adviser, Bassam Abu-Sharif, said Mr. Shamir's move was ''very funny'' since ''he knows more than anybody else that even those Palestinians he himself had met represented the P.L.O.'' ''He knows that such meetings have taken place inside and outside Israel among his ministers and P.L.O. representatives,'' Mr. Abu-Sharif said, adding that Mr. Shamir ''is trying to use the alleged meeting between Weizman and the P.L.O. to create a crisis.'' Mr. Abu-Sharif said Mr. Weizman had not met with any P.L.O. officials, although there had been indirect contacts. He did not name the Israelis he said had met with P.L.O. representatives. He also said the P.L.O. had received letters from several Israeli cabinet ministers but did not reveal the contents.\n",
            "doc 87: The newly appointed military commander of Los Santos province had just been sworn in after promising loyalty to the new President, Guillermo Endara, and the civil authorities under him. But when Maj. Cesar Dominguez arose to speak at the event last week, he took an unexpected tack. ''This is all very well and good,'' the officer told those present, according to a Panamanian Government official who attended the ceremony. ''But when the gringos leave, I will remain behind, and then we'll see what happens.'' As a silence fell over the crowd, the celebration of the restoration of civilian rule was suddenly cut short. A representative of Panama's new civilian Government consulted with the local American military commander. Within minutes, Major Dominguez had been summarily stripped of his post, arrested, turned over to American troops and replaced by a more cooperative officer, Capt. Gustavo Quintero. An Inherited Military On one level, this incident, which took place on Dec. 27, indicates that after 21 years of military rule, the principle of civilian supremacy reigns here at last. But it also illustrates the resistance the new Government has encountered as it tries to forge a new security force out of the military personnel it inherited from Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, whose situation in the Vatican's embassy here was unchanged today. ''In a revolutionary situation such as Nicaragua, the new Government comes in with its own army,'' explained Osvaldo Velasquez, who as head of the Panamanian Committee on Human Rights has been a persistent critic of military rule. ''Here there was an invasion by a foreign power that destroyed the armed forces, so the new Government has to work with the least bad, with those who have sinned least.'' By all accounts emanating from the Government, virtually all of the approximately 900 officers in the 15,000-man Panamanian Defense Forces have committed transgressions such as corruption or abuse of power, and the worst offenders will soon face criminal charges. But the Endara Government and its American military and civilian advisers argue that to form an entirely new force would take years and require the extended presence of United States forces as guarantor of public security. ''As far as I am concerned, I would like to have started completely from scratch,'' one member of the Cabinet said today. ''But you just can't do it.'' Conciliation Resented At the realization that there will be no sweeping purge of the Defense Forces grows, so does popular resentment of the Government's conciliatory approach. Around the capital, cars are now circulating with bumper stickers that demand, ''Police yes, army no,'' referring to a popular proposal to limit the new Public Force to constabulary duties and strip it of all military functions, as is the case in neighboring Costa Rica. On Saturday, a Panamanian television station concluded its evening broadcast by showing all of its footage of Defense Forces violence that had been censored by the Noriega Government. As scenes of savage beatings, shootings and destruction appeared and a narrator condemned the military for killing and exploiting its fellow citizens, the screen continually flashed a two-word message: ''Never again.'' Government officials say that even the Endara Cabinet and its allies in the Civic Crusade, who led the drive to overthrow General Noriega and often were arrested or tortured as a result of their activities, are divided on the question. First Vice President Ricardo Arias Calderon said on Dec. 27 that the former Defense Forces ''cannot be simply and purely erased,'' but ''have to be redirected.'' But many of his formal political associates have criticized this approach, arguing that the force should be abolished altogether. Public concern with the leadership of the new security force begins at the top, with Col. Roberto Armijo the Commander in Chief. Mr. Arias Calderon, who also serves as Minister of Justice and Government, and as such is in charge of security and legal matters, has said that Colonel Armijo was selected on the basis of seniority and that this principle would prevail. Led Crackdown on Protest In recent years, Colonel Armijo has held personnel and naval posts, which officials of the new Government and human rights leaders say means that his participation in the drug smuggling, money-laundering, gambling, prostitution and protection rackets that lined the pockets of many of his fellow officers was minimal. But a decade ago, then-Major Armijo was in charge of the troops assigned to violently quell peaceful protests against General Omar Torrijos's grant of refuge here to the Shah of Iran. Those actions involved mass arrests, shootings and beatings that have not been forgotten here. Mr. Arias Calderon has also said the Government intends to require all military officers to retire after 25 years of service, a legal stipulation ignored under General Noriega. If that requirement is indeed observed, Colonel Armijo will be forced to step down later this year. ''Armijo is only a transitional figure,'' the Cabinet minister said today. ''He won't be around long, you can be certain of that.'' Colonel Armijo's probable successor is his deputy, Col. Eduardo Herrera Hassan, a favorite of the American and diplomatic establishment here. But many Panamanians find him unpalatable because of his role as commander of the troops that most energetically shot, gassed, beat and tortured civilian protesters during the wave of demonstrations against General Noriega that erupted here in the summer of 1987. ''I cannot forgive Herrera Hassan for Black Friday,'' Dr. Velasquez said, referring to the day in July 1987 when the repression of street protests reached its peak. ''He directed all the operations and must bear that moral responsibility.'' Panamanian political and human rights leaders say the careers of other top officials in the new force are no less clouded by incidents of abuse. Col. Armando Palacios Gondola has been publicly accused of murder, while Col. Moises Correa is said by lawyers here to have systematically ignored the writs of habeas corpus they delivered to him when he was in charge of jails here - nearly 200 such writs on one particularly busy day. Panamanian officials said soldiers were already receiving instruction in human rights and democratic values in an effort to counter the military indoctrination they have undergone over the last 20 years. But a new public force ''cannot be a typical guy out with his baton on the beat,'' at least in the near future, a senior American Embassy official here said.\n",

            "doc 91: A former Marine sergeant who lost her assignment as a drill instructor after testifying that a lesbian colleague ''did a fine job'' has asked the Navy to award her back pay and to restore her good-service record. The former sergeant, Christine R. Hilinski, argues in legal papers filed with the Navy recently that the Marine Corps violated both her First Amendment rights and the Code of Military Justice when it reassigned her, cut her salary and put a negative report in her file after the favorable testimony she gave of the lesbian drill instructor in the July 14, 1988, court-martial of the drill instructor. Under questioning at the court-martial, Sergeant Hilinski said that the drill instructor, Sergeant Cheryl Jameson, ''did a fine job'' and that her work had not been affected by her homosexuality. Asked whether ''homosexual activity between superiors and subordinates, in your opinion, is O.K. in the Marine Corps,'' Sergeant Hilinski said, ''No, sir, it is not.'' Monthly Salary Reduced Sergeant Jameson pleaded guilty to charges of indecent acts and fraternization with a female recruit. She was sentenced to a year in prison, demoted to private and dishonorably discharged. Sergeant Hilinski's legal papers assert that four days after the court-martial, her supervisor told her that her testimony showed poor judgment because she was ''lenient in her position on homosexuality.'' Sergeant Hilinski was then removed from her duties as drill instructor and her salary reduced by $220 a month. The supervisor then put into Sergeant Hilinski's service record a report that her ''judgment is questionable,'' the legal papers say. Earlier in the month the same supervisor had filed a report calling Sergeant Hilinski ''dedicated, polished, professional and dependable'' and saying ''her judgment is outstanding,'' the legal papers say. After 11 years as a marine, Sergeant Hilinksi left the service last February. The back pay she is seeking, $1,320, represents the difference in the amount she would have received as a drill instructor and the pay she drew in her new assignment. No hearing date has been set for her petition, filed with the Board for Correction of Naval Records. Second Sergeant Reassigned Another sergeant, Gloria Gurule, who testified as a character witness for Sergeant Jameson, was also removed as a drill instructor on July 18, 1988, and reassigned. The permanent service records of both Sergeant Hilinski and Sergeant Gurule were left showing an unsuccessful tour of duty on the drill field. A Marine spokesman at the Parris Island training base, Capt. A. J. Kozloski, acknowledged at the time that the women were reassigned because of their testimony. ''They were relieved as a result of loss of confidence by their superiors based on the content of their testimony under oath in the Jameson case,'' he said. Lieut. Col. Fred Peck, a spokesman for the Marines in Washington, said it was not a question of retaliation or of punishing Sergeant Hilinski for failing to share her commander's views on homosexuality. Rather, he said, her testimony showed that she did not share a belief in the rules that her job as drill instructor required her to enforce. ''If I'm a priest who's called upon to testify, and I suddenly start espousing views that are antithetical to the church, what kind of faith is my bishop going to have in me?'' Colonel Peck said. ''What happened, as I understand it, is that her commander lost faith in her ability to perform her duties when he heard her condone a drill instructor's sexual relationship with a recruit.'' Unlawful Retaliation Charged Sergeant Hilinski's lawyer, Nan Hunter of the American Civil Liberties Union, argues in her legal papers that the reassignment was an unconstitutional retaliation for the testimony and a way of punishing the sergeant for having a different attitude toward homosexuality than her superiors did. ''It was nowhere alleged as a basis for the discipline meted out to her that Sergeant Hilinski violated any military regulations,'' Ms. Hunter's petition said, ''only that her beliefs, as expressed during testimony in a military court, did not accord with the beliefs of her commanders'' Ms. Hunter said that although the courts have upheld the military's right to punish homosexual acts they have also upheld service people's First Amendment rights to hold and express their own opinions about homosexuality. In the legal papers, Ms. Hunter also argues that Sergeant Hilinski's punishment could deter other service members from giving favorable evidence. ''The only way to avoid the chilling effect produced by the disciplinary action against Sergeant Hilinski on future court-martial witnesses is to reverse that disciplinary action,'' the petition said. ''The fairness of the military justice system requires that witnesses not feel threatened by the specter of punishment based on their truthful testimony.''\n",
            "doc 92: A REVOLUTION is taking place in attempts to understand how the continents were born and grew. Geologists once drew a simple picture of a single great land mass, assembled from earlier fragments, breaking into pieces 150 million years ago to form the continents of today. Now they say the process was much more complicated. Through much of the earth's history, they believe, continental fragments have been tossed back and forth, sometimes traveling several thousand miles. These pieces of the earth's crust, which come in varying shapes and sizes, ride atop the semimolten interior. They creep along at only a few inches a year, but that is fast enough to cover great distances when a journey lasts tens of millions of years. The revised theory has evolved over the last decade and picked up strong support in studies reported last month at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. The continents are patchwork affairs, the theory says, because they have repeatedly broken up, scattered their pieces and then reformed in different combinations. By one analysis, North and South America are composed of at least 70 fragments. In Asia, David B. Rowley of the University of Chicago reported recently, there are no less than 16 continental blocks and other formations. The North Slope of Alaska, and its structural continuation in the Seward Peninsula of Alaska and the Chukotskiy Peninsula of Siberia, are now believed to have been a single block that came from elsewhere. Its collision with the rest of Alaska produced the Brooks Range. Some geologists say the north slope of that mountain range was previously attached to the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, then swung 70 degrees counterclockwise to its current position around a ''hinge'' in the Mackenzie River delta. At the San Francisco meeting, Warren J. Nockleberg of the United States Geological Survey identified nine slivers of landscape pushed together in the Yukon region by the collision 100 million to 142 million years ago. He said remnants of an ocean basin and an arc of volcanic islands that were swept up by the collision have been found, and he reported on some of the most recent findings of a survey across a north-south line the length of Alaska. A succession of additional fragments of landscape, or ''terranes,'' drifted north to form southern Alaska and the rest of western North America. One, now the panhandle of Alaska, came from as far away as Australia, Jason B. Saleeby, a geologist at the California Institute of Technology, has reported. The key to the new concept is recognition that a series of continental formation cycles occurred, rather than the one cycle proposed in 1962 by Tuzo Wilson of Canada. He said then that an earlier Atlantic Ocean had closed about 400 million years ago, bringing together Eurasia, Africa and the Americas. They pulled apart 150 million years ago to form the present ocean, he said, completing a process now known as the Wilson cycle. But geologists now believe that there were many Wilson cycles and that they began much earlier than had been thought. For example, when scientists developed the theory of plate tectonics, which holds that continents and oceans are carried on huge plates that move about on the earth's surface, they deduced that India had drifted thousands of miles north from Antarctica and Australia before reaching Asia; the continuing collision has produced the highest mountains on earth. But now studies by scientists from America, Britain, China and France indicate that this collision was only the most recent addition to the continent. In the Dec. 8 issue of the journal Science, a French group reported that India's northward pressure continues to distort Asia, pushing Tibet east relative to the main body of the continent. The result is the Altyn Tagh fault, which runs for 1,400 miles along the southern edge of the Tarim block in western China. Satellite images suggest that since the most recent ice age, 10,000 years ago, the Tibetan side of the fault has slipped as much as 1,200 feet east. Peter Molnar of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, another specialist in Asian tectonics, described the assembly of Tibet in a recent issue of The American Scientist. Multiple Blocks in China From 130 million to 300 million years ago, he said, at least three narrow strips of continent were successively added to southern Asia. They were presumably carried on the same plate that would smash India into the continent much later, about 40 million years ago. The rest of Asia was assembled during the past billion years, according to Dr. Molnar, Dr. Rowley, Lev P. Zonenshain of the Institute of Oceanology in Moscow and others. The blocks that now make up north and south China were once separated by a wide ocean; they came together in the Late Triassic Period, 190 million years ago, Dr. Rowley said. They then collided with Eurasia, according to reports at the San Francisco meeting, based on magnetic orientations in ancient rocks of those areas. Much earlier, or about 250 million years ago, the huge Tarim basin, forming the heart of northwest China, collided with the region to the north, said Shangyou Nie, Dr. Rowley and their colleagues. The Tarim collision helped build the ranges of the Tian Shan on its northern flank, now the Chinese-Soviet border. The older generation of Soviet geologists has been slow to accept plate tectonics, but a large number of their younger colleagues told the International Geological Congress in Washington last July how they believe Eurasia came together, including successive arcs of volcanic islands plastered against its eastern frontier as the floor of the Pacific burrowed under it. At least 10 such terranes were identified by the Soviet group, some having come from as far as ''several thousands of kilometers'' away, one report said. Rift Holds Deepest Lake The geologists said the continuing northward pressure by India has caused a succession of Asian blocks to slip northeast, east and finally south, which may have helped create the long, north-south valleys of Southeast Asia. Farther west, one such rift extends north into Siberia and holds Baikal, the world's deepest lake. The collision in Tibet has produced the world's highest plateau. Although rimmed by mountains, it is remarkably flat, Dr. Molner noted. ''Off-road vehicles can travel hundreds of kilometers without encountering serious obstacles,'' he wrote in The American Scientist. Bedrock of the plateau is rugged, but material eroded from its ring of mountains and deposited on the plateau has filled the gaps and made it level, Dr. Molnar believes. Evidence of continental movements has also been observed in North America. In fact, Dr. Wilson developed his cycle theory when he realized that a stretch of land running from the Avalon Peninsula in Newfoundland to Connecticut had originated on the far side of the ancient Atlantic. Some geologists consider a similar slice of the Carolinas and Georgia to be part of this same Avalon terrane. Scientists are now trying to decipher how inland portions of North America were put together. Early in the debate on plate tectonics it was deduced that there had been a collision about a billion years ago that left the Grenville formation, a segment that runs from Newfoundland through the Adirondacks to Mexico. Paul F. Hoffman of the Geological Survey of Canada said he believes he has seen this same formation as far away as Sweden, indicating it was at one time attached to North America when the continents were assembled a few hundred million years ago. But in a recent issue of the journal Geology, he suggested that seven ''microcontinents'' came together far earlier, about 1.8 billion to 2 billion years ago, to form the central core, or craton, of North America. North Slope Debate Debate on where the North Slope of Alaska came from has been hampered by the absence of detailed mapping of magnetism on the Arctic Ocean floor. In other oceans, magnetic formations in the oceanic bedrock indicate the region's past direction of movement. But the ice cover of the Arctic has impeded such surveys. Nevertheless, Susan L. Halgedahl and Richard D. Jarrad of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory, studying rock extracted from three North Slope oil wells, found evidence that the North Slope had swung counterclockwise away from the Canadian Archipelago. This idea was proposed as long ago as 1955 by S. W. Carey of Tasmania. At the July congress, David B. Stone of the University of Alaska said magnetic evidence seemed to show a small amount of reversed motion after such rotation, perhaps in response to buffeting by terranes arriving to form the rest of Alaska. Arthur Grantz of the United States Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif., reported further evidence for North Slope rotation around a hinge in the Mackenzie delta. He and his colleagues proposed that the break from northern Canada and start of rotation occurred 150 million to 190 million years ago. Dr. Nockleberg said the terrane along the Yukon south of the Brooks Range is a fragment of a much larger terrane scattered for more than 1,000 miles along the western margin of the mountains from Alaska to British Columbia. Its origin was very distant, he said. It contains pieces of zircon 2.1 billion to 2.3 billion years old, derived from its former parental continent. Ample evidence for a collision by the North Slope block has been found along the south flank of the Brooks Range and the north edge of the Yukon Basin. Nevertheless, not all geologists have accepted the rotation hypothesis. They argue that there is no evidence for the proposed hinge near the mouth of the Mackenzie. Some have suggested that the North Slope broke away from the Lomonosov Ridge, which crosses the Arctic Ocean through the North Pole, or slid west from the Atlantic side of the continent. One proposal holds that the Lomonosov Ridge itself broke away from the continental shelf north of Europe. Dinosaurs Near North Pole? Dr. Grantz believes that the organic material under the North Slope that eventually formed one of the world's major oil reservoirs accumulated on the nearby ocean floor before the region broke loose, and that this rifting then created the tilted geologic structures in which the oil accumulated. It was much warmer then. Fossil plants indicate that at the time of the North Slope collision, the region, now barren, was covered with forests. Fossils have been found along the Colville River, which flows into the Arctic Ocean. They indicate that 65 million to 70 million years ago, or shortly after the North Slope collision, dinosaurs were thriving there, even though the region may have been even nearer the North Pole and subject to very long winter nights. Fossils have been found in southern Australia showing that dinosaurs lived there when the region was farther south and also cold. Despite such clues, there is probably no region on earth whose geologic history remains as uncertain as that of the Arctic Ocean and the lands around it. In 1970 Robert S. Dietz and J. C. Holden, in an early analysis of continental drift, suggested that there has always been an ocean there, Oceanus Borealis. In a new hypothesis, Dr. Zonenshain proposes that a continent, Arctida, occupied the Arctic Ocean, then dispersed to surrounding continents.\n",
            "doc 93: John Mackovic said the difference was rhythm. ''They weren't able to balance, to use the run to offset the pass quite as well,'' the Illinois coach said after his team beat Virginia, 31-21, today in the Florida Citrus Bowl. ''The thing that helped us today is that they could not get into a rhythm.'' Jeff George, the Illinois quarterback, threw for 321 yards and 3 touchdowns as the Big Ten runner-up dismantled the Atlantic Coast Conference co-champions. The game produced Illinois's first post-season victory in 26 years. ''Some days you feel hot, like you can throw anything you want, and this was one of those times,'' said George, who completed 26 of 38 passes. At the start of the second half, George hit 4 consecutive passes for 71 yards to spark an 84-yard scoring drive for the Illini (10-2). ''The winners of 10 games are great teams,'' Mackovic said. Illinois's last bowl victory was a 17-7 defeat of Washington in the 1964 Rose Bowl. The Illini had lost four bowl games since then. Virginia's first bowl loss in three post-season appearances gave it a 10-3 record, the first 10-victory season in the school's 101-year football history. ''Sure, we had a good season,'' the Cavaliers' coach, George Welsh, said. ''But we got beat pretty good today.'' Marcus Wilson, the Virginia tailback who ran for 1,098 yards in the regular season, was held to 10 yards today on 8 carries. Wilson also fumbled the opening kickoff, and the recovery by Illinois's Bill Henkel set up George's 15-yard touchdown pass to Steven Williams less than two minutes into the game. ''When you're playing good football teams, you don't want to make those mistakes, especially early,'' Welsh said.\n",

            "doc 95: In his final game, Bo Schembechler refused to fade quietly into the landscape of old college football coaches. He joked and laughed tonight when the Rose Bowl was over, and then he walked away with a casual wave. But deep inside, where no one could see, there must have been a seeping anger. Schembechler's retirement bash ended glumly when Southern California drove 75 yards in the final minutes to defeat Michigan, 17-10, and end the Wolverines' slim hope for a national championship. Then Schembechler issued his parting shot at the officiating, which might have cost his team a chance for a late - and possibly deciding - touchdown. ''One thing I won't miss in retirement,'' he said long after night had fallen, ''is incompetent officiating.'' The words left Schembechler's exit as something less than memorable. But the 60-year-old Michigan coach, who announced Dec. 13 that he was leaving his position after 21 seasons, had some cause for anger. The Wolverines were called for holding on a late drive that appeared to put them in position to take their first lead. A fake punt resulted in a 24-yard run by Chris Stapleton, the Michigan punter, and would have put the Wolverines at the Trojans' 31-yard line. The call negated the run, and then Schembechler, after hurling a play sheet, almost took a pratfall, losing his balance and nearly tripping over a cable. Michigan, which finished at 10-2, was assessed another penalty, this one for unsportsmanlike conduct on its volatile coach. ''It was the most unbelievable call I've ever seen,'' Schembechler said, ''and it came in my final game. It was an absolutely ridiculous call. If I see the film and I'm wrong, I'll retract what I've said. But people who saw it in the press box said it was a ridiculous call.'' Late Flag? What additionally bothered Schembechler was the fact the flag was thrown long after the apparent infraction by Bobby Abrams, who was blocking on the left side of the Michigan line, and that it was made by an official of the Pacific-10 Conference, Charles Czubin, the line judge. Asked which official had made the call, Schembechler smiled slyly and answered, ''The incompetent one.'' He also said he was initially told that the penalty was made for blocking below the waist, then changed to holding. None of the game officials were made available after the game, but a Pac-10 official reported that Verle Sorgen, the supervisor of officials for the conference, said that Abrams was called for holding with both hands. Schembechler, 2-8 in Rose Bowls, said he had always believed that the officiating crew should be neutral, coming from neither the Pac-10 nor the Big Ten. Asked about officiating in general, he said: ''You want to know what my humble opinion is? The game has passed up all amateur officiating. They can't keep up. It's too fast.'' Abrams answered questions quietly after he emerged from the Wolverines' locker room, saying: ''I was shocked. I didn't know what they could call. I didn't hold the guy. It was just a bad call, I guess.'' When the Trojans got the ball again, they made their best drive of the day, moving from their 25 to the deciding score. This was the key: Todd Marinovich, the redshirt-freshman quarterback who completed 22 of 31 passes, connected on a 20-yarder to John Jackson on a third-and-5 play to put the ball at the Michigan 24. Then Ricky Ervins, who rushed for 130 yards, did most of the remaining dirty work, carrying the final 14 with 1 minute 10 seconds to play. 'Use the Clock' ''I told the guys in the huddle that we didn't need to get it all in one shot,'' Marinovich said. ''We just needed to work our way down the field and use the clock.'' Michigan, which was behind by 10-3 at the half, got 108 yards rushing by Leroy Hoard, who became the only player the last two seasons to gain at least 100 yards on the ground against Southern Cal. But by himself, he wasn't enough. The Trojans, who finished the season at 9-2-1, won their first Rose Bowl since 1985. It was also the first for Coach Larry Smith, whose team had lost the Rose Bowl each of the last two years and who is a former Schembechler assistant. ''It feels good to get a bowl victory,'' Smith said. ''It's been a long time coming. There's no better feeling.'' Then someone asked about Schembechler. ''We're losing one of the warhorses,'' Smith said, ''one of the guys who did things the plain and simple way.'' Smith had not spoken to his former mentor when the game was over, but he said he would find him later. And what would he say? ''What I'll tell him,'' Smith said, ''is that I can't say I'm sorry, because you don't apologize for a win. But I'll tell him I'm sorry he's leaving.''\n",
            "doc 96: For many an investor, living through 1989 was like having a miserable time at what should have been a great party. Whether 1990 is any better may depend on whether interest rates fall fast enough to offset declining profits. Heiko H. Thieme, a market strategist for Deutsche Bank Capital, called 1989 ''the second-best year of the decade.'' And by the popular market averages, he is right. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 27 percent, just behind 1985's gain of 27.7 percent. The bond market also zipped along, with interest rates on Treasury securities falling and producing handsome returns for investors. So why the unhappiness? In part, it was that a lot of investors picked the wrong investments. Small stocks stumbled late in the year. Technology stocks went from unloved to despised. Bank stock investors learned that third world nations were not the only borrowers who could no longer pay, as many banks took big write-offs on real estate loans. And bond investors early in the year were much more likely to be buying junk bonds, which were soon to tumble amid a wave of defaults, than to be picking up the Treasury securities that turned out to be real bargains. Selling Low, Buying High To make things worse, most of the gains came early in 1989, when many investors were cautious. They bought later, just in time to watch prices slip. ''We saw a lot of cash come into the equity market just as the market reached its high,'' said Abby Joseph Cohen, the chief strategist at Drexel Burnham Lambert. Many smaller stocks ended the year below where they were in the first half, although larger companies generally rose. A dramatic exception was the largest stock in the country, International Business Machines, which ended 1989 down 23 percent for the year. Add to that the litany of layoffs on Wall Street, and many professional investors ended 1989 in a truly foul mood. Richard Hoey, Drexel's chief economist, reports that his November poll of investment pros found just 11.1 percent expecting a bull market in early 1990. That percentage was the lowest Mr. Hoey has recorded since he began asking the question in 1983, falling even below the 12.4 percent recorded after the 1987 crash. Such figures suggest a consensus of pessimism on Wall Street. But Robert Farrell, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch, notes that there are signs that some people are investing their money a lot more bullishly than they are talking. A survey by Indata, a service of Gordon, Haslett & Company of Stamford, Conn., that monitors institutional portfolios, indicates that managers of equity funds have just 6.1 percent of their assets in cash and short-term money market instruments, even less than the 6.3 percent that was on hand at the end of August 1987, when stocks peaked before beginning the fall that culminated in the October crash. By contrast, on Aug. 9, 1982, when investors were genuinely bearish and the great 1980's bull market was about to begin, cash levels stood at 16.9 percent. One reason for the low cash level now is that many institutional money managers think it is not their job to decide when to pull back from equities and raise cash; that is up to the client, usually a corporate sponsor of pension funds that allocates money among different managers. Late in the year, when nervousness rose, the managers did not get out of stocks, but many did move into what they thought were safer stocks. Utilities, paying a high dividend and with revenues that are resistant to recession, became market stars late in the year, with the Dow Jones utility average rising 8.7 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with a 2.2 percent gain for the Dow industrials. In mutual funds, where many managers have more leeway to raise cash, cash levels in stock mutual funds were up to 11.1 percent at the end of November, the most recent figures available. In the aggressive growth funds that buy small stocks, whose performance was generally poor in late 1989, cash levels climbed to a high 11.9 percent. Mutual Fund Sales Rise The professional pessimism comes at a time when individual investors are showing considerable willingness to buy shares. Sales of stock mutual funds rose throughout the year, and investors also stepped up their direct purchases of shares. One reflection of the improved business came in the shares of Charles Schwab & Company, the discount brokerage firm, which soared 106 percent in 1989. But the price of a seat on the New York Stock Exchange ended the year at $420,000, down 33 percent from the $625,000 price at the end of 1988, and off 63 percent from the $1.15 million peak set in 1987. While trading volume picked up a bit in 1989, institutional commission rates continued to fall, and now are down to 6 cents a share or less. Brokers are not making much money from trading, and that is reflected in seat prices. What bullishness there is now is based on a firm belief that interest rates are headed lower, as the Federal Reserve tries to keep a slowing economy from falling into a recession. The indicators that show high levels of pessimism about stocks show equally high levels of optimism about bonds. ''I think we will have a major interest-rate decline that will be much more important than earnings turbulence,'' said John D. Connolly, chairman of the investment policy committee at Dean Witter Reynolds. Mr. Connolly, and many others, think interest rates will fall fast enough to offset the impact of lower corporate earnings in early 1990. Virtually everyone on Wall Street expects lower profits in the first half of the year, but some optimists think earnings will then rebound late in the year as the economy picks up steam, allowing corporate profits for all of 1990 to exceed the 1989 level. Profit Estimates Falling Profit estimates have been coming down for the last several months, ever since third-quarter earnings proved broadly disappointing, and some who are bearish think that will continue as weak demand for goods squeezes margins. ''The consensus forecast for corporate profits is still too high,'' Mrs. Cohen of Drexel said. ''Stock prices are already reflecting the best that is likely to happen in 1990.'' As 1988 ended, the dollar was at depressed levels, but it rallied early in the year and held on to its gains against the Japanese yen and many other currencies. But the West German mark became the strongest currency, and the dollar fell to new lows in December against it and other European currencies tied to the mark. For some maturities, German interest rates are now higher than similar American rates, a historic reversal. In the long run, it is possible that the convergence of interest rates among the world's major economies - Japanese rates are also rising, although still well below those in the United States - will improve American competitiveness by allowing American companies to borrow money at rates similar to those faced by companies in other nations. But in the shorter term, Mrs. Cohen worries that a need to support the dollar could keep American interest rates from falling much further. And that, she said, would be a big disappointment for the stock market. As the year ended, there were few economists who were forecasting a 1990 recession in the United States. One reason may be that most economists have wrongly forecast one or more recessions since 1982, and many are wary of making the same mistake again. Dumping Cyclical Stocks But many investors seem unwilling to bet on a vibrant economy. In the final month of 1989, the consensus investment strategy was to dump cyclical stocks - companies like auto makers that are heavily dependent on economic growth - and buy safer stocks. Technology stocks also crumbled, capped by a decision by the Vanguard group of mutual funds to force its small stock funds, known as Explorer and Explorer II, to slash their holdings of technology stocks and to promise never again to buy so many. There are plenty of reasons advanced for the poor performance of small stocks, ranging from the belief that foreign investors prefer names they know to the suspicion that more small companies would falter in a recession. But there is no doubt they were unpopular for most of the fourth quarter. In the over-the-counter market, more stocks declined in price than rose for 11 consecutive weeks, with the string ending only in the final week of the year. The Nasdaq composite index fell 3.8 percent in the quarter. Bank stocks were weak, with smaller banks traded over the counter especially hard hit. Many of them had little or no exposure to third world debt problems, but all have real estate loans, and fear is growing about how many of those will default. In place of all those ''risky'' stocks, investors turned to stocks that might avoid severe damage in a recession, notably utilities and makers of consumer goods like food. Energy shares also rose, aided by cold weather and a growing belief that the worldwide excess supply of oil was shrinking. 'Getting Crazy Out There' To some analysts, among them David Eisenberg of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, the market went too far. ''It's getting crazy out there,'' he said. ''Did you know that the market value of the cellular telephone stocks is now equal to that of the banks?'' His conclusion is that there is value in financial and cyclical stocks, while supposedly ''safe and sound'' stocks like food issues are overvalued. Market watchers of a historical bent may take some comfort from the fact that 1989 was just the fifth year since World War II that the Dow industrials rose more than 25 percent. In each of the previous four instances, the Dow rose by at least 15 percent the following year. So there are historical reasons, at least, to hope the market's momentum will not soon vanish.\n",

            "doc 98: The Securitate, Rumania's feared internal police force under Nicolae Ceausescu, has been disbanded, and its former chief was placed under arrest Sunday after his loyalty to the new revolutionary Government came under question. The former chief, Gen. Iulian Vlad, had joined the anti-Ceausescu forces on Dec. 23, a day after the deposed dictator fled the capital and as members of his force dug in for a guerrilla war against the provisional Government. But General Vlad's loyalty to the revolution was suspect, top Government officials said today. ''Originally, he seemed to side with the revolution,'' said Capt. Mihil Lupoiu, an army officer who has been appointed Minister of Tourism. ''After four or five days, he was arrested for reasons that have to be investigated.'' The charges against General Vlad have not been specified. Information Reported Withheld In an interview today, Silviu Brucan, a former dissident who now holds a leading position in an 11-member executive board of the governing Council of National Salvation, said the general had withheld important information about the operations of Securitate holdouts. As fighting by the renegade security forces continued in the cities, it became apparent to the new Government that their movements were orchestrated and their hideouts well stocked with ammunition and provisions and that they had special means of communication and transportation, including a network of secret tunnels under Bucharest. And yet, Mr. Brucan said, General Vlad failed to confirm or produce what Government officials were certain were the Securitate's plans for such an operation. Mr. Brucan said the general, in a radio address, had also failed to issue orders to his former troops to lay down their arms, even after he had been asked to do so by his new allies. Mr. Brucan said General Vlad's loyalty was challenged on Dec. 24 at a meeting of the Council of National Salvation at which the tensions between its disparate members came to the fore. 'Haven't We Met Before' When General Vlad protested that his word was being doubted, Mr. Brucan - who had been interrogated by the general during Mr. Ceausescu's rule - retorted: ''Sure it is put under question. Don't you know me? Haven't we met before?'' Mr. Brucan said today that a majority of the Securitate agents had surrendered since the execution Dec. 25 of Mr. Ceausescu and his wife, Elena. Only a few dozen remain, he said, confirming that fighting is still going on in some of the tunnels beneath the city. The tenacity of the special police officers, he said, can be explained primarily by the money they earned: a captain in the Securitate earned more than army generals. Captain Lupoiu today explained that under the Government decree dissolving the Securitate, the force's regular troops would be absorbed by regular army units. He said that like other countries, Rumania would have an intelligence-gathering secret service. #2 Local Chiefs Killed He put the number of regular Securitate forces at 50,000 to 60,000. The numbers did not include tens of thousands of plainclothesmen. And he declined to give a number for the special antiterrorist unit, which he said was trained by one of Mr. Ceausescu's brothers. Since the fighting tapered off, and the new Government established control over the country, two local Securitate chiefs have been killed outside Bucharest and others have been severely beaten by angry citizens, Mr. Brucan said today. ''The violence was the reason behind the Government's appeal last week to stop acts of revenge.''\n",
            "doc 99: It was not until the eulogy by his sister Karen Coleman that the conspiracy of silence about the cause of Thomas E. Whigham's death from AIDS was broken. Family members had feared rejection and perhaps violence if his illness became known. But in the year since Mr. Whigham's death, this town has responded not with fear or revulsion but with a united fight against AIDS. From elementary schools to Kiwanis Clubs, Sanford has begun an AIDS-education drive and is allowing children with AIDS to attend public school anonymously. Thirty citizens, from a gas station owner to the president of the local medical association, are helping raise $1 million to establish a chair at the University of Miami Medical School. The chair, to be named after Mr. Whigham and his neurologist, Dr. Joseph Berger, would be for research on AIDS neurological problems. Here $5, there $10 - daily the contributions arrive with handwritten notes. A state senator got the state to pledge $500,000 in matching funds. The response of this town of 30,000 people is at least rare. In Arcadia, another small central Florida community, the Ray family, with three small sons infected with AIDS, had to flee in 1987 after their home was put to the torch. A court had ruled that the boys were to attend the local public school alongside other children. Sanford's reaction might be attributable in part to the fact that Mr. Whigham was dead, therefore no longer a threat, when the town learned of his disease. He was 35 when he died Oct. 18, 1988. But the reaction is also the story of a close-knit family that made AIDS a crusade when one of its own was struck down. It is the story, many here believe, of how a town's reaction to AIDS can hinge on the community standing of its victim - compassion instead of hatred if the victim is a favorite son, a former high school football star and a handsome young lawyer and family man, the father of two little boys. ''Over the years Sanford dug in its feet against change,'' said Don Boyett, the Seminole County editor of The Orlando Sentinel. ''It resisted integration, filling in the public pools rather than integrating them. Arcadia could have happened here. But Tom Whigham's death, because he was such a vital person, made us all much more aware of how indiscriminating AIDS is.'' Michael Gray, a friend and law partner of Mr. Whigham, said, ''Before Tom took ill with AIDS, I used to joke about it. Now I cry.'' His doctors say Mr. Whigham's AIDS infection was traced to a 1983 blood transfusion during surgery. The diagnosis came in the summer of 1987, when the Rays were driven out of Arcadia. Mr. Whigham's parents and six brothers and sisters were fearful of Sanford's reaction. They pleaded with him not to admit publicly that he had AIDS and he never did. But, on the long car trip back from a monthly visit to the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, he planned a citizens' conference on AIDS with Mrs. Coleman. The conference was part of Seminole County's Law Week activities. Speakers included Mr. Whigham's physician at the Mayo Clinic, Dr. Frank R. Cockerill, who is also former deputy director of President Ronald Reagan's Commission on AIDS. As an employee of the Seminole County School Board, Mrs. Coleman helped win approval of a school system AIDS policy providing classroom education and the education of children with AIDS - without revealing their identities. Also, Mrs. Coleman gives as many as five presentations a day to community groups on the family tragedy, including photographs of Mr. Whigham as a baby, a toddler, a high school football star, a bridegroom, a lawyer - and a father. She also shows a video of an emaciated Mr. Whigham, bald on one side of his head where the doctors shaved it to probe his brain, taking part in a stadium dedication. Karen Coleman had to make the thank-you speech for him. ''The Surgeon General has said that everyone will have to experience a close personal loss before they take up arms against this terrible disease,'' she said. ''I want the tragedy of Tom's illness and death to be that experience for as many people as possible.''\n"
