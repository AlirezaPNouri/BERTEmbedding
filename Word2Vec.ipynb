            "Doc 0 is --> Following the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event  the extinction of the dinosaurs and the wetter climate may have allowed the tropical rainforest to spread out across the continent. From 66 to 34 Mya  the rainforest extended as far south as 45Â°. Climate fluctuations during the last 34 million years have allowed savanna regions to expand into the tropics. During the Oligocene  for example  the rainforest spanned a relatively narrow band. It expanded again during the Middle Miocene  then retracted to a mostly inland formation at the last glacial maximum. However  the rainforest still managed to thrive during these glacial periods  allowing for the survival and evolution of a broad diversity of species. Aerial view of the Amazon rainforest During the mid-Eocene  it is believed that the drainage basin of the Amazon was split along the middle of the continent by the Purus Arch. Water on the eastern side flowed toward the Atlantic  while to the west water flowed toward the Pacific across the Amazonas Basin. As the Andes Mountains rose  however  a large basin was created that enclosed a lake  now known as the SolimÃµes Basin. Within the last 5â€“10 million years  this accumulating water broke through the Purus Arch  joining the easterly flow toward the Atlantic. There is evidence that there have been significant changes in the Amazon rainforest vegetation over the last 21 000 years through the last glacial maximum (LGM) and subsequent deglaciation. Analyses of sediment deposits from Amazon basin paleolakes and the Amazon Fan indicate that rainfall in the basin during the LGM was lower than for the present  and this was almost certainly associated with reduced moist tropical vegetation cover in the basin.[16] There is a debate  however  over how extensive this reduction was. Some scientists argue that the rainforest was reduced to small  isolated refugia separated by open forest and grassland [17] other scientists argue that the rainforest remained largely intact but extended less far to the north  south  and east than is seen today. This debate has proved difficult to resolve because the practical limitations of working in the rainforest mean that data sampling is biased away from the center of the Amazon basin  and both explanations are reasonably well supported by the available data.\n",

            "Doc 1 is --> On Wednesday, lawmakers squared off with the chief executives of the tech industryâ€™s four most powerful players: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google. Even though each company is under antitrust scrutiny for different reasons, the committee used this weekâ€™s hearing to point out similarities between all four, making the case for future regulatory reform. Since last June, lawmakers have been engaged in a sweeping antitrust investigation into the tech sector, honing in on how some of the most notable names in the industry have grown too big by allegedly stifling competition. Lawmakers have heard hundreds of hours of testimony and obtained over 1 million documents throughout their investigation, a process that made it difficult for CEOs like Facebookâ€™s Mark Zuckerberg and Amazonâ€™s Jeff Bezos to evade uncomfortable lines of questioning. Google caught fire from Cicilline for keeping a watchful eye on competitors in search. Cicilline cited emails obtained through the investigation between Google employees concerned with how competing companies were growing more dominant. For Yelp specifically, Google allegedly threatened to delist its reviews if the giant couldnâ€™t feed them into its own products. This surveillance technique extends into the other three companies as well. For example, Facebook has allegedly kept tabs on other rising tech companies, making efforts to copy them or eventually purchasing them, like in the case of Instagram.\n",

            "Doc 2 is --> Amazon has disrupted traditional retail and accelerated the demise of struggling players. Without storefronts  the companyâ€™s overhead costs are significantly lower than other retailers. That gives Amazon the edge to undercut rivals on prices and operate on a thinner profit margin. Some economy watchers are nervous about Amazonâ€™s deflationary impact. Ideally  low unemployment is accompanied by wage growth  which in turn fuels inflation as companies pass on the costs to consumers. That is the logic of the Phillips curve  but Amazon has disrupted it as well. Greater competition and lower prices can limit the ability of companies to pass on any wage increases to consumers. Those worries were echoed in the wake of the Whole Foods acquisition in 2017.4 Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans noted that mega-mergers can put downward pressure on inflation.\n",

            "Doc 4 is --> More than 56% of the dust fertilizing the Amazon rainforest comes from the BodÃ©lÃ© depression in Northern Chad in the Sahara desert. The dust contains phosphorus  important for plant growth. The yearly Sahara dust replaces the equivalent amount of phosphorus washed away yearly in Amazon soil from rains and floods. NASA s CALIPSO satellite has measured the amount of dust transported by wind from the Sahara to the Amazon: an average of 182 million tons of dust are windblown out of the Sahara each year  at 15 degrees west longitude  across 2 600 km (1 600 mi) over the Atlantic Ocean (some dust falls into the Atlantic)  then at 35 degrees West longitude at the eastern coast of South America  27.7 million tons (15%) of dust fall over the Amazon basin (22 million tons of it consisting of phosphorus)  132 million tons of dust remain in the air  43 million tons of dust are windblown and falls on the Caribbean Sea  past 75 degrees west longitude. CALIPSO uses a laser range finder to scan the Earth s atmosphere for the vertical distribution of dust and other aerosols. CALIPSO regularly tracks the Sahara-Amazon dust plume. CALIPSO has measured variations in the dust amounts transported â€“ an 86 percent drop between the highest amount of dust transported in 2007 and the lowest in 2011.

            "Doc 6 is --> Based on archaeological evidence from an excavation at Caverna da Pedra Pintada  human inhabitants first settled in the Amazon region at least 11 200 years ago. Subsequent development led to late-prehistoric settlements along the periphery of the forest by AD 1250  which induced alterations in the forest cover. For a long time  it was thought that the Amazon rainforest was never more than sparsely populated  as it was impossible to sustain a large population through agriculture given the poor soil. Archeologist Betty Meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea  as described in her book Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise. She claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.52/sq mi) is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting  with agriculture needed to host a larger population. However  recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated. Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500  divided between dense coastal settlements  such as that at MarajÃ³  and inland dwellers.[28] By 1900  the population had fallen to 1 million and by the early 1980s it was less than 200 000. The first European to travel the length of the Amazon River was Francisco de Orellana in 1542.[29] The BBC s Unnatural Histories presents evidence that Orellana  rather than exaggerating his claims as previously thought  was correct in his observations that a complex civilization was flourishing along the Amazon in the 1540s. It is believed that civilization was later devastated by the spread of diseases from Europe  such as smallpox.[30] This civilization was investigated by the British explorer Percy Fawcett in the early twentieth century. The results of his expeditions were inconclusive and he disappeared mysteriously on his last trip. His name for this lost civilization was the City of Z.\n",

A 2006 article in the UK newspaper The Independent reported the Woods Hole Research Center results  showing that the forest in its present form could survive only three years of drought. Scientists at the Brazilian National Institute of Amazonian Research argued in the article that this drought response  coupled with the effects of deforestation on regional climate  are pushing the rainforest towards a  tipping point  where it would irreversibly start to die. It concluded that the forest is on the brink of[vague] being turned into savanna or desert  with catastrophic consequences for the world s climate.[citation needed] A study published in Nature Communications in October 2020 found that about 40% of the Amazon rainforest is at risk of becoming a savanna-like ecosystem due to reduced rainfall. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature  the combination of climate change and deforestation increases the drying effect of dead trees that fuels forest fires. In 2010  the Amazon rainforest experienced another severe drought  in some ways more extreme than the 2005 drought. The affected region was approximately 3 000 000 km2 (1 160 000 sq mi) of rainforest  compared with 1 900 000 km2 (734 000 sq mi) in 2005. The 2010 drought had three epicenters where vegetation died off  whereas in 2005  the drought was focused on the southwestern part. The findings were published in the journal Science. In a typical year  the Amazon absorbs 1.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide  during 2005 instead 5 gigatons were released and in 2010 8 gigatons were released. Additional severe droughts occurred in 2010  2015  and 2016. In 2019 Brazil s protections of the Amazon rainforest were slashed  resulting in a severe loss of trees.[108] According to Brazil s National Institute for Space Research (INPE)  deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon rose more than 50% in the first three months of 2020 compared to the same three-month period in 2019. In 2020  a 17 per cent rise was noted in the Amazon wildfires  marking the worst start to the fire season in a decade. The first 10 days of August 2020 witnessed 10 136 fires. An analysis of the government figures reflected 81 per cent increase in fires in federal reserves  in comparison with the same period in 2019.[110] However  President Jair Bolsonaro turned down the existence of fires  calling it a  lie   despite the data produced by his own government. Satellites in September recorded 32 017 hotspots in the world s largest rainforest  a 61% rise from the same month in 2019. In addition  October saw a huge surge in the number of hotspots in the forest (more than 17 000 fires are burning in the Amazon s rainforest) - with more than double the amount detected in the same month last year.\n",

The size of the Amazon forest shrank dramatically as a result of settlersâ€™ clearance of the land to obtain lumber and to create grazing pastures and farmland. Brazil holds approximately 60 percent of the Amazon basin within its borders  and some 1 583 000 square miles (4 100 000 square km) of this was covered by forests in 1970.

In the 1990s the Brazilian government and various international bodies began efforts to protect parts of the forest from human encroachment  exploitation  deforestation  and other forms of destruction.

Shoppers are already more likely to search Amazon for product information and reviews than even Google. Once they become accustomed to going first to Amazon  they cease to even compare prices  sometimes paying more for a product thanks to the convenience and perceived value of Prime. it s a genius move by Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos  but chilling when you stop to think about just how much control that gives the company. Walmart  though  is positioning itself for an epic battle with Amazon and its recent $3 billion purchase of Jet.com will help it better compete with Amazon s marketplace and technology platforms while leveraging the a vast distribution network that includes more than 6 000 stores. ILSR contends that Amazon s growing dominance poses a threat to the economy through increased monopolization in industry and declining property tax revenue. There s also the rise of low-paid jobs in Amazon warehouses and fewer small businesses that make for vibrant communities.\n",

            "Doc 18 is --> Amazon previously disclosed that 200 million people pay for Prime memberships  and subscription revenue for that service and others reached almost $7.6 billion in the quarter. In addition to paying Amazon $119 a year or $12.99 a month for free shipping and other perks  households with Prime memberships typically spend $3 000 a year on Amazon  more than twice what households without the membership spend  according to Morgan Stanley. The high volume of orders during the pandemic has let Amazon operate more efficiently. It has run its warehouses closer to full capacity  and delivery drivers have made more stops on their routes  with less time driving between customers. The number of items Amazon sold grew 44 percent  but the cost to fulfill those orders was up only 31 percent. The pandemicâ€™s shift to remote computing was also a boon to Amazonâ€™s profitable cloud computing business  Amazon Web Services  which had $13.5 billion in sales. â€œWe certainly had strong volumes really across all of our businesses â€ Amazonâ€™s finance chief  Brian Olsavsky  said on a call with reporters. He said the company is investing heavily in future growth. It spent almost $50 billion in capital expenditures in the last 12 months  largely on building out its logistics operations and data centers  up 80 percent over a year earlier. Mr. Olsavsky said he expected â€œanother strong yearâ€ for capital spending. â€œIn just 15 years  AWS has become a $54 billion annual sales run rate business competing against the worldâ€™s largest technology companies  and its growth is accelerating â€ Jeff Bezos  Amazonâ€™s founder and chief executive  said in a statement. Mr. Bezos plans to step down as chief executive later this year and transition into the role of executive chairman. Amazonâ€™s total work force dipped slightly between December and the end of March  falling by 27 000 to 1 271 000 employees globally. That was still 51 percent more workers than the same period last year. On Wednesday  Amazon announced it would increase pay for half a million workers and was hiring â€œtens of thousandsâ€ more\n",
